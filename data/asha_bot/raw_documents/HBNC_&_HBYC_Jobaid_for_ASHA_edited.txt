Job Aid for Home Visits by ASHA
(newborn and young child)

###about home based care
• home based newborn care (hbnc): you are already providing follow up care to the mother & newborn by conducting visits on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 & 42. for home deliveries, you conduct an extra visit on day of birth. by providing postnatal care to mother & essential care to newborns, you can identify, and promptly refer sick newborn and mothers with post natal complications thus preventing sickness and improving survival

• home based care for young child (hbyc): this is a new initiative launched under national health mission & poshan abhiyaan. asha will now provide additional home visits to children when they turn 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and 15 months of age. these visits are designed to improve nutritional status of young children, ensure proper growth, early childhood development, prevent childhood illnesses (such as diarrhoea & pneumonia) and deaths resulting from them

###planning for home visits
to make a home visit, you are required to carry the following—
• asha diary/register: to maintain a list of all newborns and young children (upto 15 months of age) in your area
• hbnc & hbyc cards: to record details of services you have provided. this will also serve as the basis for your incentive payment. also record visits in the mcp card
• hbnc kit: this has (1) digital watch (2) digital thermometer (3) weighing scale & sling (4) baby blanket (5) spoon (6) medicines & consumables check functionality of equipment
• asha drug kit: this has the medicines & supplies (such as ors packet, ifa syrup) that you will distribute to family of young children
• mcp card: carry at least one mcp card to help you explain the key messages (in case mother cannot find the child’s mcp card)


##What are the the principles of communication for a successful home visit?
• greet appropriately and ask how the family is
• explain the purpose of your visit
• ask open ended questions (where you can get responses from the mother/parents and not just yes/no)
• encourage the mother/parents and family members to speak
• listen patiently to when mother/parents and family members speak
• praise what the mother/parent/family member is doing correctly and build up their confidence
• try to find out reasons why the mother/parents are finding it difficult to follow a particular child care practice. empathize with the family if there are any problems. discuss possible solutions
• use simple words in local language when giving advise
• involve both the parents during the visit, whenever possible. encourage father to be involved in care of the child
• asha job aid

• measure and record temperature of newborn
• check mcp card for birth dose of vaccines (given or not)
• check the newborn for cracks or redness on skin folds or pustules; oozing umbilicus; eye discharge; yellowness in eyes or skin; signs of sepsis

• if baby weighs <2.5 kg & temperature < 97 degree f, counsel about keeping baby warm (maintain room temperature, provide skin to skin contact and frequently feeding the baby)
• if <1.8 kg; advise regarding kmc, feeding expressed breast milk and refer
• inform parents the due date for first dose of vaccines
• provide care for skin, cord and eyes

#refer newborn if 
• signs of sepsis are present. give referral dose of oral syrup amoxicillin

##explain danger signs and how to keep the baby warm
Counsel the family about danger signs in the baby: not able to feed; weak cry or limp; breathing is fast or difficult; feels hot or cold to touch; yellowness of palms and soles.
inform parents that under janani shishu suraksha karyakaram free treatment and transport is provided

#how to keep the baby warm at home
if the baby is small then provide skin to skin contact (kangaroo mother care) as much as possible, day and night.
when skin to skin contact not possible:
• mother lies together with the baby on a soft, thick bedding
• cover the baby and mother using additional quilt, blanket or shawl in cold weather
• keep the room warm with a home heating device
• clothe the baby in 1 2 layers (summer) and in 3 4 layers (winter)
• cover the head, hands and feet with cap, gloves and socks respectively

##ensure compliance with exclusive breastfeeding
• ask the mother: do you breastfed the child? how many times? do you give any other food or fluids?
• exclusive breastfeeding means giving baby only breast milk, and no other liquids or solids, not even water upto 6 months of life. medicine drops or syrup can be given, when prescribed by a service provider
• explain that all mothers produce enough breast milk for one or even two children up to 6 months of age. build her confidence and support her to breastfeed
• if mothers wants to resume work, counsel her to feed the child before going and after coming back. she can express breastmilk, which can be given to the child for the day
• frequent breastfeeding will help the mother produce more milk
• emphasize on demand breastfeeding both day & night. at least 8 times per day
• during every visit in newborn period and 3rd month visit, emphasize the importance of exclusive breastfeeding
• in visits from 6th month onwards, counsel mother to continue breastfeeding along with complementary food

##start complementary feeding after 6 months

at 6th month visit, advise mother about starting complementary foods in addition to breastfeeding
• these are food items given to the young child after the age of 6 months when the breastmilk alone is not sufficient to meet all the nutritional needs of the child
• quantity increases with the age of the child and at about one year of age the child gets half the mother’s nutrition
• make child’s food energy dense by adding a spoon of some edible oils or fats/ghee/butter; sugar/jaggery (gur) to each feed
• variety: add fruits and vegetables. the rule is that the greener it is, or the more red and yellow is the feed, the more is the protective quality
• give food items that are locally available, fresh and seasonal
• frequency increases with the age of the child and number of feeds will increase gradually with increase in age of the child
• store food safely by keeping it in covered utensils
• remember that consistency of the food depends on age of the child and readiness to chew and swallow. initially include soft and mashed foods. move gradually to foods with appropriate thick consistency so that it is energy rich
• thick food stays on the spoon. thin food fills the stomach but does not provide sufficient energy

##iron and vitamin c rich complementary foods prevent anaemia

ask parents if they have heard of anaemia (khoon ki kami)? explain that anaemia means low hemoglobin in the blood, which results from iron deficiency

iron helps in physical and mental development of the child. it improves well  being, makes the child more energetic, alert and attentive. it improves school performance

#advise parents to introduce iron rich & vitamin c rich complementary foods after age of 6 months. talk about food items that are available locally and seasonally:
• iron rich food items are dark green leafy vegetables (sarson saag, turnip leaves, methi, bathua, pudina, chaulai, dhania, palak), sprouted pulses, cereals, jaggery, fresh peas, fresh beans, watermelon, raisins, animal foods (e.g. meat, fish, chicken, egg). 
• vitamin c rich food like tomatoes, citrus fruits like orange, lemon, amla, guava, melon, cabbage, cauliflower, etc. enhance absorption of iron.

• mark a tick (√) in the mcp card after giving a dose
• give iron syrup half to one hour after feeding. not to give iron syrup with milk. not to worry if child has black stools. this is expected when child takes iron syrup
• bring the child to the anm if there is any problem after giving the iron syrup


inform parents that

• during sickness, give small frequent meals and more fluids, including breastmilk
• encourage the sick child to eat and drink by offering the foods that the child likes
• after recovery from illness, give the child more food and more times than usual, at least for a period of two weeks

##play and communicate with the child
#ask the parents/ mother
• how do you play with the child? 
• how do you talk with your child? 
• how do you get your child to smile?
observe the mother and father/family members playing with the child and note if the baby responds appropriately
give parenting tips as described in mcp card. during each home visit, explain how the mother/family members can play and communicate with the child appropriately for the age
#explain
• babies can see, hear and feel right after birth. their brain develops most rapidly in first 2 years
• parents should play and communicate with the child right from birth
• while breast feeding the baby, mother should hold the baby close, look at the baby, smile, sing, touch and stimulate (stroke baby’s head or back lightly)
• as the child grows older, play and communication activities are combined with other activities such as feeding, bathing etc
• malnourished children may not be very active but they benefit from stimulation through play & other activities

• discuss the progress in the growth of the child during each visit by referring to the gender specific growth chart
• if the curve is moving upwards: it means that child is gaining weight. praise & reinforce the good practices of the mother/caregiver
• if the curve is flat, but has not gone down to another colour band: it means child is not gaining weight. identify feeding problems if any, and give appropriate feeding advice. check for any episode of illness. take corrective action. follow up for compliance
• if the curve is moving down, into another colour band: it means that child is losing weight. refer the child to anm/awc/phc for further assessment
• explain the importance of regular weighing. ensure registration of all children at the nearest awc. ensure that every mother takes the child to awc every month for weighing specially a sick/malnourished child

##advise the family on the importance of handwashing
