asha: my eight tasks

Knowing our village people 
Improving health status of our people is a teamwork. you require participation of everyone—the people, the nurse, the anganwadi, the dai, the schoolteachers and the village panchayat. you also need the help of doctor. you will need to work with all of them so that people remain healthy.

village people are not as rich as city people. they have to face many difficulties. they depend on land and farming. some of them also work as wage labourers in nearby towns. in many villages, rearing cattle is a source of income. most farmers depend upon rains. many work as artisans. they work hard to live their life

some people are too poor. they are grouped as below poverty line (bpl) as per government criteria. often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and other marginalized groups. families belonging to bpl are eligible for special benefits under government schemes. a village may have different settlements for different castes.

everyone needs health care. yet some groups of people are vulnerable to sickness. the poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people need health care more often. their health needs are not adequately met. they have little or no money. at times they have to take loans at very high interest rates to

get admission in hospitals or to buy medicines for their kids. your role is to guide them to get good care in time and that is affordable

village people have a practical sense of solving problems with simple resources. thus they should be involved in village health planning to assess health needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address the common problems.

schools, fair price shops, water, electricity, seeds, fertilizers, credit, animal care, bus/jeep, roads, employment, forest produce, common grazing grounds, post  office, haat—we need all these services in the village. health care is just one more. it is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village. as asha, you shall do your best to help your own people in their struggle for health and share joys of life. people have expectations from you. in following pages, you will learn about your specific tasks to be undertaken by you as asha

Village Health plan
 you should participate in village health planning and help nursedidi, anganwadi behen, and panchayat members. this will be the foundation of all health work in the village. village health planning helps us to select important health issues and make a work plan to solve them. everybody's participation is necessary. ngo workers, school teachers, representatives of self help groups will also help in micro planning. you should ensure that marginalized population groups such as scheduled castes, tribes, minorities and women are adequately involved in the planning process. when people participate in planning, they also help in offering solutions and carrying out the tasks

most villages will have health and sanitation committee. the committee members take initiative for development of village health plans. village health planning needs some facilitators they bring people together, activate them to think and plan with people, map out problems and encourage solutions. depending on the availability some ngos workers can provide facilitation. teachers can also help you. you should work proactively with anganwadi behen and nurse didi to decide on the venue and timings for the planning meeting.

village health plans provide a framework for health related actions. many actions lead to health. village planning is a community approach to solve problems. you will learn more about it in the subsequent exposures of our learning programme.


example: development of a plan for tackling sanitation problem in village

let village teachers, nursedidi, anganwadi behen, artisans, panchayat members, ngo workers meet and form a core group. you will be one of the members of this group.

this group should go around village observing village sanitation and other problems. you may involve students in village rally so as to raise awareness of sanitation issues inform about time and venue of planning meeting. songs and street plays also invite attention of people.

then gather in a central place open to all. draw a village map on a big paper or a wall. ask people to draw their house in the map. map waste water cesspools in village. discuss about problems. the village planning may take 2 3 days also

ask people sources of wastewater flowing in the street or in cesspools. mark the house with things like tamarind seeds, small stones etc. mark houses having fever cases. the nursedidi, and the anganwadi behen and mpw will check the houses. they will discuss about malaria with villagers and talk of solutions. think of solutions to eliminate breeding sites for mosquitoes. you can handle more problems in the same meeting. think of handling problem of malnutrition amongst children in your village and how such exercises can be useful.

communication for health behaviour change
 health information and communication is more important than pills and injections. proper information and advice help people to avoid diseases and stay healthy

health information is a lasting asset. currently villagers especially poor women, men and adolescents do not have access to information on health issues. you can fill this gap and act as a local resource on health issues. availability of information will trigger changes in health promoting behaviours and adoption of healthy practices.

we should select issues close to people's hearts and needs. attend to more important problems first.

see what people already know and build on existing knowledge base.

understand the problems from their viewpoint also.

share health information with them and find possible actions.

find effective ways of how people learn to change their ways.

use any of these occasions for bcc: group discussion, personal discussion, demonstration, village meetings, clinic contacts, exhibition, camps, self help group (shg) meetings, meetings of adolescents, religious gatherings, haat bazaar days etc

use aids for bcc: chitrakatha, flip charts, booklets, posters, prabhat pheris, songs, models, puppet shows, street plays etc

look for innovative methods in communication. for instance, one voluntary organization painted all the bulls in the village with health slogans on the traditional bail puja day. the moving slogans stayed for weeks.

assess impact of bcc efforts. has it changed how people think? has it changed the way they do things? has it improved utilization of health services?

enable people to change their behaviour such as construction of sanitary latrines in their house.

and remember all advice is good if you can follow it in similar situations. you will learn more about bcc in this programme

Linkages with AWW, TBA, ANM, MPW

during your work, you need support of other persons engaged in health related activities. in the village, we have anganwadi, the dai and some other healers. we will learn more about them soon.

the anganwadi worker (aww) anganwadi is for village children under six years. they get supplementary feeds in anganwadi centre (awc). aw behen weighs children regularly and keep growth cards. as asha, we can work with the aw behen and nursedidi on child health activities, and assist her in organising fixed monthly “health day”. they also provide supplementary food for pregnant women.

the village dai the village dai helps in childbirth. she conducts childbirth and attends newborn. she gets training and kit for clean childbirth from the primary health centre/sub centre (phc/sc).


other healers the village vaid uses herbal medicines. he may have some knowledge of herbs and some ayurvedic remedies. some cures may be good. faith healers practice cures with help of mantras and mindtechniques. they are also called as “bhopas”, “ojhas” in some communities. people go to them for some types of illnesses. the advise given by them may be of doubtful nature.

the nursedidi (anm) the nursedidi is very important for all our work. she works from the health sub center. she visits 5 6 villages and hamlets in turns. her work includes: immunization, care of mother and child, childbirth, contraceptive services, some medical aid etc.

the swasthya karmi (male worker) he also helps the nursedidi in her work. he gives fever treatment, medicine for tb and malaria. he also helps in controlling outbreak of diseases in the village.

Counselling people often need help to find solutions to their health problems. here are some health related issues you can offer help

- adolescent health

- pregnancy and childbirth

- abortion,

- childlessness

- child health and nutrition

- immunization

- unmet needs of contraception

- intimate problems like sexually transmitted infections/aids.

- chronic ailments like cancers, tb, leprosy,

- choosing simple health care options

yes, you may not know these problems fully. but you can certainly help people where to go. you may also explain them as what kinds of solutions are available in a given situation. you may also follow up with them and find out how they are using the help. if there are any problems, you can suggest alternative ways.

counseling needs knowledge of the subject. knowledge grows with time and more reading and discussing. counseling also needs skills about talking with different persons—men and women, young and old etc., understanding their viewpoints. it calls for sensitivity and empathy

counseling also needs motivating skills. different problems involve different solutions. therefore motivating becomes necessary. we often do it in the family. this is how we arrive at a decision after weighing pros and cons of several alternatives.

you can also do effective counseling after some experience.

escorting patients to a hospital
many people need to go to a town or city hospital for higher care. they feel lost and helpless in such situations. often, they face difficulties in such situations. also somebody from the family has to stay back to look after children and cattle, getting money, farm work etc. they often need you to accompany them

you can ensure that needy people get the right help. you also can help in deciding to go at the phc, community health centre (chc) or the district hospital. if the chc is far away, people may choose to go to other suitable private or trust hospital. in some emergency situations (like bleeding during or immediately after birth) time is precious. situations that need escorting are:

- childbirth and immediately after childbirth, difficulties during pregnancy and childbirth.

- abortion and bleeding

- aseriously sick child

- avery sick person, like brain malaria. heat stroke

- someone wants to know about his/her tb or suspect hiv

- accidents like snake bite, burns, serious injury, poisoning, drowning

- clients for accepting iud or sterilization.

you need to have necessary information and skills. knowledge about which hospital to take to. what is the distance?

help family in decision making. you need to decide with the family about where to go.

arranging transport with help of the villagers

sending message to the hospital. (learn to use a telephone if available).

escorting helps

good and timely first aid and escorting can save lives and reduce harm. it also improves your relation with the families and enhances your credibility in village. this will make your linkages with the hospital.

pprriimmaarryy mmeeddiiccaall ccaarree people need curative care for many health problems. we have to offer relevant, effective primary medical care to the needy. good primary medical care helps to:

- save time and money for families

- reduce possible damage to health and life threatening complications

- make easy many of your health tasks in the village people value your service

your role is: 

- treat all simple illnesses (like coughs and colds) with simple cures. many health problems are simple in nature.

- help in moderate illnesses (like diarrhea) and watch for early signs of dangers and refer if necessary

- facilitate early detection of early serious chronic illness (like tb and cancer) and refer. this is great help you can do.

- ensure proper first aid in accidents before referral/escorting.

- depot holder for common health care commodities

however you should be careful for: = do only what you know surely. ask for help when necessary

- use only medicines and care advised in this programme

- do not wait for cure for more than 2 days in any illness you are not sure of.

- explain side effects of drugs you use.

- explain possible risks in some illnesses (like childhood ARI).

- keep drug stocks ready and safe, away from reach of children


Act as Depot Holder

She will also act as deport holder for essential provisions being made available to every habitation like oral rehydration solution (ors), iron folic acid (ifa) tablets, chloroquine, dispozale delivery kits (ddk), oral pills and condoms etc. a drug kit will be provided to you. contents of the kits will be based on the recommendations of the expert/technical advisory group set up by the government of india include both ayusg and allopathic formulations

records and registration 
- register every birth/still birth

- register every birth/still birth with the gram panchayat within 14 days.

- register every death with the gram panchayat in 7 days.

- keep record of your work in asha register/diary.

- keep a diary for noting your experiences, difficulties and thoughts.

- tally your records with records at anganwadi and sub center and meetings.

if you notice that number of girls borne in your village is much less than boys, be alert as it may be due to the “sex selective abortions”. you will learn later as what will be your role in preventing sex selection of fetus.

in case of unusual occurrence of any disease in your village, you need to inform concerned health authority i.e. in charge of local phc.

Staying healthy 

A saying on health
"Pehla such Nirogi Kaya" is one of the saying. it means healthy body is the most important pleasure of life

good health leads to productive, happy, and a long life. both the body and mind need to be healthy. and our relation with the society should also be healthy. people often think health is linked to medicines, doctors and hospitals only. this is not always true.

hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. but first we need to take care of our body. you can prevent diseases, promote health and prolong life.

in this lesson we will learn about what is health? what make us healthy? what leads to ill health? how health and ill health assessed?

we say aarogyam dhansampada. this means health is real wealth. health makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. ill health keeps us away from work and livelihood. ill health means spending on doctors and medicines. in villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle to pay for hospital expenses. the money people spend on tobacco and liquor also causes ill health. following health practices protect our wealth and increase productivity.


How to remain healthy?
 some parental gifts make part of one’s health. like body features, frame, height, weight, looks, skin and color, some mental traits etc. sometimes we even get some health problems linked to parental gifts. we can avoid marriage among blood relatives to

avoid some of these inborn defects.

many social and economic factors also cause ill health. poverty is the root cause of many sicknesses. low purchasing power limits access to food and adequate amount of balanced diet. women suffer from sicknesses during the process of giving

also health care utilization is impacted adversely on account of poverty. ignorance also contributes to sickness. certain traditional practice are harmful. you should try to know about these traditional practices in your village.

a lot of health depends upon factors like

- clean drinking water, clean air

- balanced diet,

- healthy personal habits,

- healthy home and surroundings

- healthy working conditions.

- supportive family, friends and society

- staying away from vices like alcohol, tobacco, multiple partners etc

timely use of health services like immunization, birth spacing, mosquito bed nets etc is also necessary for health. if we fall ill, seeking treatment early is very important in several illnesses. examples are tb, cancer, high blood pressure, pneumonia, snake bite etc. late action may harm. every hour counts in such situations.

to stay healthy, we need to adopt healthy practices, and use health services in time.

How to assess health and ill health
we often say that one looks healthier than someone else. healthiness shows up in happiness. but we often use ‘measures’ for health.

when selecting young men/women for police or army, parameters such as height, weight, chest circumference etc are used. we also use several tests (eyes, blood, urine etc) to test assess health of an individual

we can talk of ill health in similar ways. we relate ill health to illnesses—cough, fever, diarrhea, tb, polio, drunkenness etc. at the level of community we use similar words. for instance, we say there are more people having fever this year than the last year, or fewer people with diarrhea or no case of aids in this village. or more infants dying in this village as compared to other village.

some examples of how we discuss health and ill health in the village:

- this year we have more/fewer fevers in the village.

- how many tb patients in the village?

- mother and child deaths in the village in last year.

- number of underweight babies in the village.

- number of teenage girls giving birth to babies.

- number of smokers and alcoholics in village.

- mental attributes are people happy, number of suicides etc.

you can make our own checklist based on our situation and needs. a comparison tells us if our village has better health than the last year or the next village

think about: 
- why people have to take loan for getting treatment in hospitals?

- why women feel hesitant to talk about their health problems with male doctors?

- why people keep on waiting for days and months for seeking treatment?

personal hygiene 

in this lesson we will learn about

importance of personal cleanliness viz. hand washing, cleaning teeth, nail cutting, daily bath, clean clothes, footwear, hair care.

Cleanliness and health
cleanliness is next to godliness. many illnesses spread due to lack of cleanliness. illnesses like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, worms, typhoid, skin infections, louse infestations and dental problems etc are examples

Toilet practices
 in india many people go to open fields for defecation. you need to help them in getting sanitary latrines installed. these are convenient for young girls, women, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go to fields. you will get more information about construction of sanitary latrines from the block panchayat office. after defecation, most use water wash for anal clean up. this soils the hand with germs. it is necessary to wash the hands thoroughly after this, with soap or ash. some people use paper or leaves of some trees for anal clean up. this may be actually healthier as avoids soiling of hands with germs

hhaanndd wwaasshh many diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid etc are caused due to germs present on dirty hands. you should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before eating any food. wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap and see the difference in wash water. you will appreciate the difference. after going to the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly.

wash the hands with a lot of water first. apply soap or ashes and rub on the hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. again, pour water. dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin.

cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. long nails may be fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.

Our mouth and teeth
our teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. food particles collect in the tooth gaps. this leads to tooth problems and swollen gums

we must have a good mouthwash after each meal. this will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. just imagine what happens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and not cleaned overnight. it stinks badly. similarly if we don’t clean our mouth after meals it will also stink. never have a bed tea without mouthwash.

discourage use of raw or burnt tobacco for cleaning teeth. that causes stains. smoking also makes teeth dirty.

use of ash is good, but it cannot clean the gaps.

Regular tooth brushing will remove the plaque
use a soft bristled brush. be sure it is the right size (a smaller is better than a big one)

place the brush angled to the teeth. brush the teeth toward the gums. brush very gently so that any plaque growing under the gum will be removed. brush the outside, the tongue side and the chewing surfaces of your teeth. brushing tongue will make your breath odorless. stale food and germs can collect on your tongue and cause bad breath. brush at least twice every day, before and after sleep. this would prevent plaque formation.

brushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums.

change the brush if the bristles look spread. a worn out toothbrush will not clean our teeth.

toothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. therefore brushing is a cheap way to keep the teeth and gums healthy

Datoun
 people in the village often use datoun, a 8 10 inches long and small finger thick twig of neem, babool or karanj etc. this practice is good. after chewing the twig a bit, the end becomes bristly. the bristles can clean gaps between teeth. the medicinal properties of datoun keep the gums healthy. datoun should not

ne used if there are any ulcers in the mouth. gargles with lukewarm water are good for mouthwash after meals and particulars after eating sweet foods.

Daily bath
our culture regards daily bath as a ritual. it is indeed necessary in hot weather as sweating makes us dirty. (in very cold regions one may skip daily baths.) use water economically. some people like hot water. massage with warm sesame or mustard oil is good before bath. temperature of bath water should be neither too hot not too cold. after retiring from daily work, we should wash feet, hands and face with water to remove dirt and sweat

Clean cloth
clothes with comfortable fitting be used according to season. cotton clothes of light colour are more comfortable in summers and warm clothes in winters. our undergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infections and louse infestation. a daily change is healthy practice.

Hair care combing the hair everyday is necessary for its health. a head bath is necessary especially if your hair stinks due to sweating. mixture of shikakai, reetha and amla soaked in water is a simple, cheap and safe way for washing oily and sticky hair. for louse, we need fine combs. avoid using somebody else’s comb as it may have louse

Footwear proper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from getting onto your feet. many people walk or children play barefooted in the fields. sometimes these fields are also used for defecation. the worms present in the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed. you will learn more about these worms in subsequent books. dusty and hot weather also cracks our soles. some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals or when going out to meet their friends and relatives. this is not good. the indian custom of keeping footwear outside the house is good. everyone including children should always wear shoes when going outside their houses. shoes are necessary for those who get cracked heal.

water safety at home

in this lesson we will learn about  how water is important for human health?  how water becomes unsafe for drinking?  how to make it safe at home? 

Importance of water in health
water constitute about two third of human body. a child’s body has some more water than old people. is life indeed. water delivers oxygen and nutrients to different parts of body and removes toxins and wastes. our ancestors have taught us to worship water sources in the village. good water is god. but dirty water can be demon.

many illnesses come from consumption of dirty water. diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, jaundice etc are some such illnesses. half of illnesses can be due to dirty water.

How water becomes unsafe
water becomes bad when disease causing germs mix in. germs come from human and animal excreta. even minute quantities of excreta can make water unsafe. you may say that water appears to be clean but there may be deadly germs inside not visible with naked eyes. so rivers and streams get germs once they pass through human settlements. water from shallow wells, ponds is also contaminated with germs. human activity in vicinity of water sources make these water reservoirs contaminated

How to make safe water at home
 use only safe sources   a clean hand pump or covered sanitary well or piped water supply. fetch the water at evening and keep it covered and still overnight. stale water is safe at least for two days.

if necessary strain the water in a fold of cloth. it will remove bigger particles and some insects. use a clean dhoti or sari.

for any turbid water, use alum to settle dirt. for this just dip alum in the water for 2-3 rounds and then keep away.

do not dip hands in the water container. remember your hands may be dirty. children are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their hands especially after play. use a ladle (handle cup) instead.

we can also make water safer by boiling it for about 15-20 minutes after the rolling starts.


chlorine addition is just one way of making water safe. overnight storage of water makes it practically safe. boiling is good, but also needs fuel

if you have chlorine drops, add 2 drops in one bucket. use this water after keeping half hour. if you have no chlorine drops, we can make a stock solution from bleaching powder.

take one liter water in a jar. add a teaspoonful of well kept bleaching powder to it. usually bleaching powder is available with mpw or nursedidi. stir it well and keep it still for five minutes. pour the solution into a plastic bottle using a strainer. keep off the un dissolved powder. cap the bottle and you can use it for 2 days. take 5 ml (in a big spoon) and add to one bucket of water and stir it well. use the water after half an hour. keep the stock solution well capped. otherwise the chlorine gas escapes making it useless. all families in neighbourhood can use from same stock solution. in times of outbreaks of water borne diseases, every family should take extra care. never drink water you are not sure of. water safety is possible at home, and at the village also.

7 disposal of  disposal of  waste water waste water 

in this lesson we will learn about
how do wastewater pools harm our health? how to dispose wastewater in village so that this is seen an asset and not a health hazard? making a kitchen garden and a soak pit

Waste water an asset, not a health hazard
 pools and streams of wastewater are common scene in a village. nobody likes it. this dirty wastewater is from our baths, kitchens and cattle  shades. mosquitoes breed in such stagnated pools. they give us sleepless nights and malaria fever. many deaths occur due to malaria, and many more fall sick and suffer. malaria fever increases risk of abortions. some other illnesses also spread due to mosquitoes. we can avoid all this at little cost and effort.


wastewater pools also stink. they make life difficult for those staying nearby

it is a hazard for small children. children can fall in these cesspools and hurt themselves.

we can put the wastewater to good use for a kitchen garden. this will enrich our meals and avoid sleep less nights. if kitchen garden is not possible we can dispose wastewater through a soak pit.

A kitchen garden
kitchen garden is a way to use wastewater to produce vegetables for ourselves. the plants use up the water and we get fresh vegetables at no extra cost. what we need is only some place to do this. the vegetables we can grow are: carrots, tomatoes, gourds, lentils etc. we can have about 20 varieties of vegetables. we should also grow commonly available medicinal herbs such as tulsi, kumari, podina etc alongwith vegetables for use of common ailments.

if we have more waste water, perennial trees, fruits and plants like drumstick, mango, guava, lime, papaya and banana most people like

fruits and we certainly need them for vitamins and minerals.

Making a soak pit
soak pit must be used to avoid pools of water, particularly in the streets and common pathways.

we can construct a soak pit near our house and around public places. this will absorb drumfuls of water without forming a pool. this will avoid breeding places for mosquitoes.

dig a pit of 1.5 meter length, breadth and depth. at the bottom put loose stones and brickbats. after filling 1/3 of the pit put smaller half size brickbats. fill 1/3 of the pit thus. fill the top third of the pit even smaller brickbats.

we need to avoid rain water from entering the pit. for this raise its borders by 10 centimeters above the ground level. fill it with dry grass or coconut coir on top. better put a used earthen pot at top, with hole in bottom. this helps in straining. connect the wastewater into this pot by using a pipe. cover entire area with coir. the coir works like a filter. clean or change the coir every month.

you can learn and teach people by demonstrating a soak pit construction. you may also get more information from panchayat. explain people about nuisance of waste water. motivate people to develop kitchen garden in their houses. discuss this issue in the village planning meeting. people can help each other in constructing soak pits.



8 our health depends our health depends on food we eat! 
in this lesson we will learn about the importance of food elements and simple nutrition messages.

food: critical to good health 
- we all need to eat enough and good food every day to stay healthy

- eating all types of food is necessary for keeping our body fighting fit.

- we need to eat more food when recovering from illness.

- a child needs more food for growth. so do adolescents.

- heavy work requires more food.

- men need little more food for energy in the body than women.

- a woman needs more food in pregnancy and breast feeding. she also needs supplement of iron and calcium.

- certain foods need to be avoided in certain diseases.

- all grains and cereals are our staple food. they give us most of energy and proteins. but we need to eat enough of these. similarly non veg. communities take meat and fish.

- malnutrition contributes to more than half of childhood deaths.

Healthy dietary practices
food items in the meals should have all the tastes. sweet food are heavy to digest and hence should be consumed first. avoid overeating. always try to heat, when one feels appetite. do not skip meals for long intervals if there is no medical indication. while eating the simple rule is   donot overfill the stomach, one third of the stomach should remain empty for facilitating proper movements and digestion of food. do not eat too hot, too cold and too spicy food. never eat hurriedly. combination of dal and cereals (like khicri) is healthy practice.

- we should eat thoroughly washed vegetables and fruits as well as cooked meals.

- we should eat sprouted grains as often as possible. such grains are rich with nutrients.

- washing and then cutting vegetables saves important vitamins and minerals. if we cut and then wash, these elements are wasted. (find out the difference yourself. which process makes the wash water green?)

- iron vessels are good for cooking food as they provide iron.

- use clean utensils for cooking food.

- covering food while cooking saves some vitamins.

- fresh cooked food is better than stale food. avoid storing cooked food and store until next meal.

- food should be covered to protect from dirt and insects.

- washing hands before cooking and eating prevents germs entering our bodies.

- feed children more often, 4 5 times a day. they need to eat frequently. from one year onwards, child can eat from family pot.

What is balanced diet?
food has five basic elements: fats (fats from oils and ghee), proteins (white of egg, pulses milk) carbohydrates (cereals, sugar, sweets), minerals like calcium or iron, and vitamins. minerals and vitamins are necessary in minute quantities. you will learn about nutritional values of commonly consumed food

food grains like rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra etc make the bulk of our daily food. they give us energy. some people think that only rice and wheat are good. the reality is different. bajra, ragi, jowar, maize are not inferior foods. these also rich in nutrients.

pulses and beans provide body building elements. meat, eggs, fish and milk and milk products are richer in proteins.

oils and ghee provide lubrication besides extra energy. children need to eat enough fats. weight for weight, they give double energy as compared to cereals.

green leafy vegetables and fruits help in blood formation. vegetables also give us the fiber

(roughage) necessary for normal bowel movements.

body requires some minerals like calcium, iron, iodine and zinc. some nutrients called vitamins are necessary in small quantities. both these are present in vegetables, fruits, sprouts and salts.

you know that drinking water is good for you, but did you know that every systems and organ of body depends on water. water is essential for all body functions.

do not
- do not drain and throw away extra water while cooking rice.

- do not overcook vegetables.

- do not over polish rice or remove bran from flour.

Concept of a square meal - A colou rful meal
a square meal has many colours.

- the grains are white or brown. eggs and fish are also white  grey. milk and curds is white

- pulses are yellow. so are fats and some fruits

- leafy vegetables are green.

- fruits are mostly red and orange. so is meat and chicken.

our health depends on food we eat!

together they provide all the necessary elements for health. combination of foods like pulses with grains (khichdi is good), and lemon with vegetables improves quality of food.lemon, guava and amla increase iron absorption and help make our blood healthy red. fermentation and sprouting increase vitamins in the food.

Avoid junk foods
many people like junk foods like cold drinks, pastries, chocolates, and overfried food items. these are available in many villages and roadside shops now. hats and fairs also offer such foods. children and young people take to such fancies. are they really good?

no, nutritionally they are not good : these are also unnecessary. they may have harmful preservatives in them. the costs are high in comparison to our usual foods e.g. sattu made at home. so we have a double loss.

what do you think about this?

- pregnant women, breast feeding mothers, growing children and adolescents have special nutritional needs. do we give them less?

- cleanliness in food handling and storage is as important.

- whether a person eats vegetarian or non vegetarian food, balance in eating all elements is necessary.

- food fads and taboos can lead to poor health. what are common food fads?

- gur  chana, palak, soya, idli sambar, sattu are healthy foods.

A healthy person has healthy weight
our body weight is due to our bones, flesh and blood.

a growing child gains weight regularly. generally a child triples its birth weight at the age of one year. adult maintains body weight. weight reduces in old age.

underweight is because of under eating. majority of village women and young girls have low weight. poor diet leads to poor growth in children. several children in our society are malnourished

over eating leads to storage of fat in the body. fat people can get certain illnesses—high bp, heart attacks, diabetes, joint pains etc.

hence measuring weight is important

- child who is not gaining weight or losing weight can be eating less or be a sick child (learn it from anganwadi behen).

- pregnant woman should gain weight steadily.(learn it from nurse didi)

- diseases like tb, aids and cancer cause weight loss.



9 body mapping and body mapping and overview of organs 

in this lesson we will learn about

different organs of our body, mapping organs on the body and about which organ does what.

Organs and systems
like we build our house, nature has built our bodies. for a house we need stones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipes and wires etc. from these we build foundation, pillars, walls, rooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchen chulha, drainage etc. all these parts have different purposes. similarly in the body we have many parts or organs for different functions. together they make the human body.

different organs doing different work are linked together as organ systems. various systems do various tasks necessary for life. so we have systems for breathing, blood circulation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. and all the body systems work in cooperation. the body has control systems for this, viz brain, nerves and hormones

bones and muscles make the frame and walls. this also makes movement possible. small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of different shapes. about 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. the joints make movement possible. hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. and joints are so different.

you  may  have  seen  the  guts  of  sheep  or chicken.  human  gut  is  about  22  ft  long  more  than  a  room  length.  gut  is  part  of the digestive system and digests/absorbs food.  while  passing  through,  food  will be mixed with secretions from different glands.  it  also  throws  off  the  waste. whatever body cannot put to use in sent in  large  intestine  and  later  leaves  body through  anal  opening.  digestion  gives  us energy  to  work  and  nutrients  to  build  and  repair the body. 

respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. lungs inside our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. impure air is let out. oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy.

we have about 5 6 liters of blood in our body. this goes in rounds thanks to our heart pumping each second. do you know how much blood the heart pumps in a day? that will fill a water tanker of 10000 liters in 24 hrs. the heart keeps your blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs and nutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body. younger you are faster is your heart beat. the blood carries nutrients and oxygen. it also picks up wastes from the organs. blood works like trucks and wagons in the body, through the vessels.

urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. skin also throws out sweat.

reproductive system is different in men and women. it helps in reproduction and continuation of life on earth

we know the world through our five windows. we call them sense organs. the eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure, vibration and pain.

thanks to the nervous system, we respond to these signals. human brain is most complex object in the world. we make necessary movement or change alertness. this is necessary for our survival. the nervous system controls several body functions. nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.


Mapping and learning more about our body
some of our organs are seen from outside like eyes, ears, breasts, testes. let us see where the other organs are - 

bony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame. skin covers all the body and protects it from outside environment. soft organs are inside the chest and abdomen. brain is inside the skull

a butterfly like important gland (thyroid) is present in front of the neck. goitre is actually a swelling of this. iodized salt prevents it.

when we take a deep breath the chest expands. the lungs inside the chest and fill like balloons. the wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs. it indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk.

fear or excitement speeds up the heart. normally heart beats are 72 84 times in a minute. we can feel the beats pounding in the chest. put an ear to your friend’s chest. can you hear heart beats? where is it? heart is just left of the middle of the chest. pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of the body. these carry blood from heart to all parts. can you see the veins under your skin? blood is brought back to heart through veins

let us drink a glass of cold water. do you feel it going down from throat to stomach? food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upper abdomen. stomach stores and digests food for 1 2 hours. then the food passes down the gut.

do you feel the rumbling in abdomen when you are hungry? a long coil of gut is in the middle of abdomen. this does further digestion. the long coils lead to a wider short pipe called colon. the well known appendix sits on the colon on lower right corner. appendix does not serve any special purpose in the body.

colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen walls  going up from lower right side, and then becomes horizontal going left. then it goes down to the bag storing waste. finally it reaches the anus.

liver is high up on the right side. a swollen liver can be felt below the lower right ribs. similarly on the left side we have a small spleen. in some diseases such as malaria, spleen becomes very big. we can feel it below the left side ribs

two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. they sit on the very back wall of abdomen. urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes.

one feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time. that is where the urinary bladder is. from bladder the urine is let out through a single tube opening on genitals.

Reproductive organs are different in men and women. testes are hanging in a pouch to keep them cool. from the testes two thick cords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. they make semen carrying sperms. the semen is thrown out through urethra at the end of sexual intercourse

in women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. uterus  the womb is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside down in the lower abdomen. it is protected by the pelvic bones. the womb grows in pregnancy with the growing baby inside. in pregnancy we can feel the womb on the abdomen.

two egg tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. the tubes have free finger like ends. the fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. the two ovaries flank the uterus.

outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women.

in men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. the urethra opens on the end of a long muscular penis.

in women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. inner vulva is soft tags of flesh. these are aptly called inner lips of vulva. the inner lips are connected above at clitoris. clitoris is small external bud like organ. a fleshy cushion of vulva called outer lips protect all these parts

the vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. hymen, a thin sheet with holes covers the vaginal opening. this may be torn after puberty. after puberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. breasts also grow in women at the age of maturity.

at maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.

many young boys and girls are unawares of these differences. during adolescence their bodies start changing and maturing. they become sensitive to the differences. you will know more about the health needs of the adolescents in subsequent books.

girls may be embarrassed by the growing breasts and height, and some of them take to stooping posture. boys often worry about the differences in the size of growing penis. differences in growing moustache or beard and change in pitch of voice can also bother adolescent boys

explain these changes to growing children. with maturation comes the responsibility. responsible sexual behavior is necessary for health.

we will learn more about organs and systems when it is pertinent for an illness.

10  women and health women and health 
in this lesson we will learn about
why women suffer more ill health and neglect
attitudes of society on women’s health

Women and health

many people in our society consider women as inferior than men. diseases amongst women and young girls are not taken up seriously.

women work both at home and outside. women have to spend considerable time and effort for child care. fetching water and firewood take many hours of hard work by women. tedious work in farm can lead to health problems.

women work hard but get lower wages.

women get less food at home. in fact they eat at the end when every one in the family has eaten. most women are anemic and weak. their weights are too low to be healthy

women are given less opportunity for education.

women have less say in decisions in the family.

many men women treat women badly, and even beat them. women are also sexually assaulted. such women suffer from injuries and other health problems.

women’s health problems are often ignored or treated late. they have to get permission of the in laws or husband’s even for health check up. they often have no money to pay for health care on their own. our health services are also not fully sensitive to women’s health care needs.

infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. but usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis treated

if a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. in reality it all depends on the man’s sperm. we will learn later to see how the sex of the baby is determined. many families go for abortion if it is a girl baby in the womb as they want sons. you can check from your anganwadi behen as how many boys and girls are registered at aanganwadi centre.

women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. they also bear burden of preventing pregnancies. most contraceptive methods are for women and very few for men.

women’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually transmitted infections. vagina provides a larger surface, delicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness to make germs stay alive for longer. so they get more infections than men.

even illnesses affect women differently. malaria fever can cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb

on top of all, women are married young. they suffer its damage in several ways socially, economically, and to health.

alcoholic husbands exploit women in several ways. they treat their family member harshly everyday to show off the manhood. it makes women’s already difficult lives all the more miserable.

there are fewer amenities for toilets for women. in the village, they have to go to answer nature’s call either early morning or evening.

villages may have no air pollution, but that is not true for women. they work in kitchen smoke for 4 5 hrs everyday. it gives them coughs and headaches.

and do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men. if they get the justice in our families and villages, they will be healthier still.

What we can do
let women also take part in making decisions in the family and village. they should participate in all meetings. this will make decisions wiser and more practical

- discuss with men to share domestic work and child care.

- encourage women to eat well and take enough rest.

- encourage girls to go to higher school and learn.

- try to stop physical or mental abuse of women.

- do not ignore women's health complaints.

- raise your boys and girls with equal respect and love.

let us think about it 
pregnancy and child care can be shared by the couple.

is it right to sex select babies like some people do? can our world be without women?

women and men are born equal. there are many goddesses in our mythology. then how can we ill treat and abuse women?

why men don't come forward to accept contraception?

11  organising a group meeting 

in this lesson we will learn about
how to organize a group meeting

in this lesson we will learn about one way of communication — group meetings. you have to match the group, topic and method of communication. mismatch of these three will not produce any impact. for instance for bringing behavioral change about sanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men).

we can plan and do it as follows:

get a group of 5 10 women/men (not more) in somebody’s house. it is good to select a is accessible to all especially women from scheduled castes/ tribes are comfortable. it is useful to select a house, which already have a sanitary latrine.

you need to communicate to people in advance about the venue and timing of this meeting. you can also talk with members of self help group in the village.

we can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. just provide the beginning or let someone begin.

gradually other members of group will also start participating in the discussion and share their problems.

if we have a model or flip chart about sanitary latrine, we can share it now. if someone in the village has got a sanitary latrine to a smokeless one, that can be a demonstration.

explain the basics of the sanitary latrine, and how one can make it. a good flip chart will have all that explained in pictures.

discuss ways of how panchayat can help families in constructing sanitary latrines and what assistance is available.

while conducting a group meeting:

- set up some ground rules in the beginning. let one person speak at a time. talk with participants with full interest and eye contact. you should be convinced of the topic yourself for full confidence

- let your audience participate in the discussions .encourage them to ask questions. some people will come out with good ideas. never scold or ridicule anyone. let things proceed in democratic manner. let people suggest solutions.

- do not open up topics which are ambiguous or difficult. the message should be clear and doable for the group.

- you may not complete the topic in the same meeting. one can follow it up in the next opportunity. but take things a step ahead.

- communication is effective if we follow our own advice at our home. people learn better with live example. they learn even better by doing it themselves. mere talk, pictures, slogans, songs may not work. (these things have a complementary role)

- do not underplay the complexity of the problem. problems can be really complex. we need to understand the factors and the interplay. for instance


some people say that there is no water to use in sanitary latrine. now you have to come up with solutions

change may be slow. however in every community there are some innovators who are open to new ideas. you need to encourage them . sometimes new generation takes up changes faster than old people. change is often slow. people cannot give up traditions easily since they find it easy to work with. new things need adjustment.

at the end sum up the discussion and what was decided in this meeting.

think about following : 

- some people dominate in group meetings and while some do not speak at all. what should be done?

- i lack confidence while speaking in a group. what should be done?


12  know health services  

in this lesson we will learn about  who are the health workers in village?  what do we mean by sub centres and phcs? 

Our health workers
dai: in each village you will come to know about dai ma. there may be more than one dai ma in a village. dais conduct child birth, although it is not possible for them to manage women when there are difficulties during child birth. you need to develop rapport with dais in your village. try to find out them if they have undergone any training in past. we will know more about dai in

anganwadi behen: do you know about the anganwadi behen in your village. what are her functions. we will know more about her work in the following chapter.

you will have to work very closely with anganwadi behen. one day in each month is observed as “health day” at centre. you need to mobilize children, pregnant women for health services offered by nurse didi on health day.

nurse didi: where does our nursedidi work from? it is a health sub center. the sub center actually works for 5 6 villages (3000 5000 population). we have a nursedidi called anm and a health worker brother called male multipurpose worker (mpw). together they do various tasks for the villages. we will need to work with them more closely.

The health sub center
let us look at our sub center more closely. the health sub center may be your nearest health facility. our sub center has a nursedidi and a mpw. their main tasks are:

- immunization of children to prevent six dangerous illnesses. routine checkup of pregnant women, normal conducting deliveries and post natal care.

- helping couples to adopt spacing and sterilization services.

- treatment for tb, leprosy and malaria

- treatment of minor ailments.

- visiting anganwadis and schools for health check up.

- child care including treatment for diarrhea and coughs

- advice on village sanitation, water safety etc

the anm and mpw have difficult tasks. the villages under their care spread out on 8 10 km area. they have to often walk distances, and be on move. they visit houses to conduct provide some services. for some services like immunization, they conduct clinics on a fixed day each month in a central place such as anganwadi centres in the village. they have also to make reports of monthly health activities and attend meetings at phcs.

We can do this
develop good links with nursedidi and mpw. know about the facilities available with them. help them in their tasks.



A primary health center (PHC)
 a phc is usually at some big village in your area. your block may have 5 10 phcs. each phc has 5 6 sub centres and serves 25000 30000 population. each village falls under one of them. have you ever been to the phc?

a phc has 1 2 doctors, nurses, compounder and other staff. with its 4 6 subcenters the phc’s main activity is for preventing diseases, promoting health and treatment of illnesses. here are the main activities:

national health programmes related to women and child health, malaria, filariasis, tb, leprosy, blindness, sexually transmitted infections and hiv aids. some specific activities are:

- immunization against six diseases.

- health services for pregnancy, childbirth and after.

- health check up and treatment of school children.

- control of disease outbreaks  like diarrhea.

- treatment of diseases.

- birth spacing and sterilization, early and safe abortions.

- health education to promote health and prevent illnesses

- camps for disease detection and treatment, sterilization etc.

- health care during of haats and melas.

- medico legal work.

the phc doctor has many tasks to do. treatment of illnesses is just one. he also has meetings to attend and he may also be required to conduct post mortems.

phc doctors treat illnesses in the out patient department (opd). some patients are admitted in the phc. sub center health workers refer patients to phc. the phc may also refer some patients to the chc or district hospital. some patients may need to go to the district hospital.

each phc doctor also visits sub centres covered by that phc. doctor has to supervise work of nursediddi, meet villagers and also provide services.

We can do this
inform people about the facilities available at these health centers. for instance, talk of childbirth or tb treatment and free care.

motivate people to use available services at the health centers

discuss with the doctor or nurse about the health problems of your village community. inform them about unusual health problems in your village.

13  anganwadi centre

in this lesson we will learn about

the village anganwadi centre,

the services offered through anganwadi.

how can asha and aww help each other?

anganwadi
 the village anganwadi is the place where children under six years gather everyday for three four hours.

the anganwadi behen’s activities are: - weighing children every month and record on a chart.

- if a child is not gaining or losing weight, she tries to help.

- supplementary feeds for children.

- offer supplementary food to pregnant mothers too.

- helping with pre primary education for children—through stories, _ pictures, songs ete.

- advising the mothers about healthy ways of preparing foods.

- getting health check done for the children. the nurse didi (and sometime, doctor) check the children every month. sick children get medicines. she also refers sick children

- helping in immunization of children.

- registration of births and deaths at the village panchayat

- with help of anganwadi behen, we can detect child malnutrition in time and help to those suffering with malnutrition.

Anganwadi-behen needs help
you can help her in so many ways.

the babies younger than 3 years cannot come on their own in the aw. mothers sometimes bring them to aw at mealtime. however, often they are either left at home or taken along on work. many babies suffer under nutrition after breastfeeding stops. they remain undernourished. how can we help in this problem?

parents assume that the child gets a full meal in the anganwadi, and may give it less in the home. this makes the supplement less helpful. you need to talk to child’s parents on this.

some difficulties about regular food supply affect aw services. you can raise these issues during meetings with panchayat members

anganwadi behen has some records to keep. she is often hard working and gives lot of time for this work. she can be of great help to you in all your works. with her help, you can improve child health services and services for mothers.

she also has some medicines for common illnesses. you can get help from her if you have some medicines in short supply.

things we can do for improving anganwadi 

- register all children below 6 years of age to anganwadi. encourage the parents to send their children to anganwadi regularly once they are registered.

- help the anganwadi behen in her activities. learn the tasks like weighing babies, detecting illnesses mark growth charts and understand if there is weight loss.

- counsel the mother (and father also) at home, with help of anganwadi  behen. talk to her about right feeding of care of the child.

- motivate the mothers to get check up done during pregnancy and motivate parents to get their children immunised.

14 village birth attendant or dai 

in this lesson we will learn about 
the dai and her work 
the six clean practices in childbirth limitations of dai 
how we can help and learn from her

dai’s work and practices 

- dai helps families during childbirth. she is trained by phc and anm to observe six cleans.

- a clean place to conduct delivery

- clean hands with water and soap before delivery.

- a clean perineum to avoid infection of mother and baby.

- clean thread to tie the umbilical cord and

- a clean new blade to cut the cord and keep the end clean.

- a clean cloth to wrap the baby

with this she can ensure the health of the newborn baby and mother. she can save babies with proper baby care. she is also expected to send mothers with difficulties to health centers in time

Limitations of a Dai
dais have limited understanding of a difficult birth and risks. often they refer a mother too late. they need good training and help to understand impending dangers and refer escort in good time. some village dais act as a cord cutter only. she is not very active on the after care. this period is important for both the mother and the child.

often she gets no support from families

Skilled birth attendant
a skilled birth attendant is one who knows how to conduct deliveries, prevent, diagnosis and manage complications, and refer in childbirth. she can detect dangers soon enough, do necessary things to avoid complications and offer primary treatment like stitching wounds and give medicines for stopping prolonged bleeding. she is trained and equipped to do this. the nursedidi can be a good skilled birth attendant. it will be good if families can take the mother to the nearest health center for childbirth, or the nursedidi attend at home.

things we can do 
- help the dai while she conducts delivery.

- find out from dai about pregnant women for anc services.

- learn to help her in newborn care.

- visit the mother with dai and nurse didi

15 illness and healing

in this lesson we will learn about
what is illness, its causes, germ illnesses, immunity, healing? in this lesson we will learn only about germillnesses.

Causes of illnesses
 illness is a loss of health. often it is temporary as body heals itself. sometimes it can be long lasting. why do we fall ill? here are some common causes.
- unsafe water and poor personal hygiene

- under nutrition and over nutrition

- accidents and injury, animal and insect bites

- mental tension

- changes due to ageing

- pollution of air, also noise pollution.

- unsafe sex

- addictions

Healing
 body has a capacity to heal itself. have you seen how a tree heals its axeinjury? first the gum fills the gap. the gum hardens and gradually becomes wooden. same a similar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. so you can see a scar replacing an injury. so are the scars of injury or a wound. not all illnesses make a scar after injury common cold, flu, malaria, sore  eyes are some examples. but some illnesses cause a scar inside the body. tb is one example. it leaves a scar in the lungs after cure.

some illnesses have a cause in the mind mental illnesses.

healing is a natural process. good nutrition and immunity help healing. healing leads to cure. and most illnesses heal. but some can get worse as they have no cures. can you name some diseases with no cure

Germs, worms, insect-illnesses and immunity

most of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. we can often see worms in the excreta. the small insects like louse are visible. the scabies insect is even smaller. germs are too small to see with eyes. for this we need a microscope. have you seen a microscope.

examples of germ illnesses are: malaria, chickenpox tb, measles, leprosy, many types of diarrheas and dysentery. the gravity and period of illness vary with the germ type and our resistance to that germ.

immunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. immunity develops as body gets experience of

fighting germs. immunity helps us recover from a germ illness. immunity may be natural like in leprosy. remember only some people get leprosy illness, many escape it

mother’s breast milk gives some immunity for the baby. the first few days’ thick milk is a priceless shield for the baby. sadly, many infants do not get it because wrong beliefs and practices.

we can also create immunity against some germs. we give babies vaccines to make them stronger against some illnesses. complete immunization in time prepare body to fight against germs of certain diseases.

for many germ illnesses, we use medicines. tb, malaria, and leprosy are some illnesses we can cure with medicines.

but some illnesses like hydrophobia; aids, etc are without effective cure. these small germs are called viruses. recently aids has some good medicines though no permanent cure is possible.

think about this
- how can we increase our resistance to illnesses so that we do not fall ill?
- why we not see the small pox these days?
- do you come across about hydrophobia patient in your village? why are people so afraid of a dogbite?

16  using remedies using remedies 

in this lesson we will learn about
different healing systems like the allopathic and indian system of medicine (ism)
use of select allopathic medicines in primary care,
abuse of injections and saline, avoiding overuse of medicines.

Different healing systems

nature heals most illnesses. our body has such healing properties—like the tree healing itself. we can help the process of healing with medicines. we need good nutrition for that.

we have many types of healing systems. the angreji system is well known. ayurveda employs herbal and other medicines. sidhaa is a similar branch. unani is also herbal system. homeopathy uses very small dose of medicine in sugar based tablets. naturopathy uses water, mud, diet etc for cures. yoga also heals some illnesses. in acupressure and

acupuncture, special points on the body are used to cure health problems. in the village the traditional baid uses herbal remedies.

You will learn about some medicines in this programme

The allopathic system
about 300 allopathic medicines are essential for a hospital. for primary care we need very few medicines.

in this programme you will learn to use 4 medicines/drugs. some paracetomol chloroquine (chloro), iron folic acid (ferrous) and ors. you will learn to use medicines belonging systems to (ayurveda) later.

annexure at the end of this book tells you about use of each drug; dose, how many times to be given, side effects, and precautions. read carefully all this before using the drugs.

these medicines are safe, cheap and very effective. they will help us in many illnesses. we will learn about some more medicines in the subsequent books.

Overuse of Injections and saline (bottle) 
injections and saline are necessary only in some situations

injections and saline used in clinics are not so often necessary. frequently injection and saline are given for profit and not for cure. false beliefs about injections and saline are rife. we become poorer by paying the hard earned money for many needless injections and saline. we can save these expenses with help of simple remedies and raising health awareness. but peoples’ attitudes take time and efforts to change.

patients are being charged anything like 50 rs more for one bottle. it is just water and salt and some sugar. if we prepare and drink at home it, the cost is just fifty paise. its effect by mouth is also equal to saline. some patients insists on injections and bottles and doctors also are driven by profit motives. you can educate people about utility/futility of injections and bottles.

Tonics
tonic bottles are also very popular. many healers prescribe and patients ask for tonics. are tonics necessary, do they give us strength as promised?

the answer is no. no medicine book prescribes tonics. tonics are just some water, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. the cost is often very high. in the

same cost one can take an egg daily or a glass of milk for a full month. this is a much better buy for the money. tonics also create a false sense of cure. many parents wants their doctors to prescribe tonics for their children.

you need to educate people on the futility and costs of tonics. it will save peoples’ money being wasted. it will also help them in improving their diet.

Avoid self-medication
some people buy drugs for illnesses without information. some people use medicines lying in the house for illnesses. this can be unsafe. expired medicines can cause health problems

Avoid overuse of medicines
medicines are very useful and are life saving at times. overdose can be harmful, especially in children. medicines can have side effects too. you should ask your doctors about the dosage schedule of drugs. inadequate dosage doesn’t help. education about rational drug use in community will help our work. and prevention is better than cure. we need to learn and teach how we can avoid getting illnesses by improving our living conditions.


17 home remedies

in this lesson we will learn about
some plants and trees with medicinal use
simple home remedies and herbal remedies

Five important medicinal trees and plants
our country has a very rich source of medicinal plants. we can use these for being healthy and treat ailments at little cost. some trees in the neighborhood are angels in green. we will learn about just five of them now.

1. neem (azadirecta indica) neem tree is well known. its leaves, fruits and outer portion of the stem have medicinal property.

leaves are used for skin diseases like eczema, infection. the oil prepared with extract of neem leaves is useful in itching and wound healing. the decoction of crushed neem leaves is also used for the same purpose. neem is a great antiseptic and pest control medicine. decoction of the outer portion of its stem is also helpful in various diseases. therefore, preserve and cultivate neem plants.

making neem oil: make 100 ml fresh juice of neem leaves. add 25 cc sesame oil to this. slow boil the mixture under cover. the water part will completely evaporate in half an hour. cool and filter it. this is neem oil for wound care. keep it in a well capped bottle. it will stay for one year. apply this to wounds 2 3 times a day. this heals the wound well.

for childbirth injuries, neem water bath is a healing treatment. crush some leaves of neem and put them in warm bath water. let the mother sit for fifteen minutes in this bathtub.

2. tulsi (oscimun sanctum) tulsi is a small herb, but having great medicinal properties. tulsi leaves are mainly used for some ailments. they are useful in cough and cold. give the tulsi juice with honey. the leaves are hot in nature, that is they are used in kafadosha. the decoction of tulsi leaves is also useful for cough. the leaves are chewable

the seeds of tulsi are cold in nature. hence the seeds are used in heat (pitta) disorders like heart burn, bleeding from nose, burning feet, bleeding piles, sore mouth etc. give the seeds with milk or ghee. soak 20 30 seed grains in water or milk. this is a dose for once. take it 2 3 times a day.

take about a cupful of tulsi leaves. soak them in water for five minutes. then crush them on a stone. strain in cloth and collect about 20 ml juice (half a cup). crush more leave if necessary to make 20 ml. this makes 3 doses for one day for an adult. this is good for cold and fever illnesses. give it for 3 days. for children the dose could be 10 leaves juice, 2-3 times a day

3. kumari (aloe vera)

kumari (aloe) is a garden plant. in wounds, we can appear aloe in place of a medicated dressing. take a piece of aloe about the size of the wound. cut it into a slice. clean the wound with water. apply the aloe slice on it and tie up with a clean cloth bandage. change

home remedies  61 

the dressings everyday. it heals faster. it is very useful for burns treatment as dressings.

kumari is used in several ayurvedic preparations. it is useful for liver disorders and women’s illnesses like pain in the periods. it is also used for dandruff and for the growth of hair.

you can grow kumari in your garden and ask people to grow in the kitchen garden. it is hardy plant and stays for years.

4. adusa (adhotoda vacica) adusa is small shrub grown for fencing. it is good remedy for coughs. use fresh juice or decoction of leaves. fresh juice of leaves is used with honey. it is useful for bleeding disorders eg. blood in cough, blood in stools, urine etc

take 50 60 gms of adusa leaves and wash them clean. slow boil the leaves in one liter of water for half an hour. about one fourth water should be left. this is adusa kawatha for coughs. cool and filter it. give 20 ml once, 2 3 times a day for three days. one can add sugar or honey as per requirement.

5. kuda (holerrhena antidysenterica) this is a forest tree with typical fruits. the fruit is black in color when fully ripe. the fruit is like thin doubledrumstick but in twins. the bark or cover of the tree stem is used for medicine. this is a good medicine for loose motions and dysentery. you can simply groind a piece of bark and mix with a spoon of honey and give as medicine. kadha (kawatha) also is useful. for this take a 10 gm (2 teaspoon full) of bark powder, add one glass (200 ml) of water and boil. boil it till ¼ water remain. cool and bottle it. for an adult 20 ml kadha (kawatha) for 3 times a day is useful to stop dysentry.

Some simple home remedies
haldi (turmeric) is a powder of a root. it is widely used in our country in food as spice and as medicine. its medicinal antiseptic properties are known since hundreds of years. for bleeding wounds press with haldi powder to stop it. haldi also has great wound healing properties. people use haldi with oil for cuts and abrasions. this is good practice. the practice is to apply it with milk and chana dal flour (besan) at the time of bath, as ubtan to improve complexion.

we will learn more on herbal remedies with other illnesses and topics in the next book.


18  preventing unwanted pregnancies 

in this lesson we will learn about
the links between childbearing and women’s health.
how abortions can also be harmful and can be avoided.
couples have unmet needs of contraception to meet.
the couple’s options deciding number of children needs to be respected.

Childbearing affects women's health
early marriage and teenage pregnancy is damaging to a woman’s health in several ways. it leads to abortions, premature births, risky childbirth, small baby, and subsequent effects on the family. it takes away the joy of living, prematurely. girls tend to drop out from school due to early marriage. we can stop early child marriages by creating awareness in community. talk about laws against child marriage.

repeated pregnancies cause anemia, cancer cervix and prolapse of uterus. repeated childbearing causes a woman lot of stress. her health deteriorates.

abortions are best avoided, except when essential. we will know about termination of pregnancies in other books. unsafe abortions through illegal providers (quack or doctor) are riskier than childbirth. abortions can also cause infection and sterility. in india abortion is legal and can be obtained on specified grounds.

abortion is available at recognised mtp centers on specified reasons such as danger to life or risk to physical and mental health of woman, pregnancy on account of rape and when there is risk that child is born will suffer from deformities and diseases.

however, selection of sex of foetus is illegal and abortion should not be sought eliminating female fetuses.

Contraceptive needs
 many couple don’t want more children.they also want some years gap between children they are not using contraceptives for various reasons. you can help them in meeting their contraceptive needs. planned pregnancies and births can add to the joy of life. couples can plan it with help of safe days and other contraceptive methods. spacing between two children keeps mother and children healthy.

contraception methods are available to prevent and space pregnancies. preventing unwanted births is a right of every woman and couple. we should try and meet this unmet need

Reversible contraceptive methods
we have temporary (reversible) and permanent contraceptive (sterilization) methods. in the next chapter we will talk about condoms for men.

use of condom by the husband is the easiest options for spacing between two children. condom is a rubber balloon available at phc or sc health workers, or at the common village shops. you will also have condoms in your kits. it prevents entry of seeds present in semen. condoms also prevents infections in genital tract of women and men. condom should be removed carefully after each intercourse to avoid leakage. if not used properly this method may fail.

iud is a device used for spacing. it is inserted in the uterus. doctor or nurse puts an iud in uterus after proper examination. this method is most reliable. proper selection of a woman is necessary for iud. there are other temporary contraceptives available for regulating interval between two births

oral pills: woman has to take one tablet daily for 28 days. injectable contraceptives are also available with private practitioners. we will know about these methods soon.


Choices in matter of contraception: government policy does not promote any specific method for contraception. each women and couple has to decide about particular contraceptive method based on their reproductive intentions and preferences, after analyzing information about contraceptives and matching their own preferences. you can counsel the couples about contraceptive methods.

as asha, you should counsel couples about available contraceptive methods. you can also get more information about contraceptives from nursedidi and doctor.

think about this: 
- abortion is good family planning method.
- decision about family planning method should be left with the nursedidi/doctor.
- government should give incentives for those accepting sterilisation

19 condoms: an option for men

Use of condoms
 condoms provide protection against unwanted pregnancy sexually infections including hiv/aids. a new condom is to be used each time of sex. correct and consistent use of condoms is essential.

following steps needs to be followed.

- squeeze the tip of condom and put it at the end of erect penis

- keep sqeezing while unrolling the condom until it covers all penis. the loose part at end will hold semen.

- after the men ejaculate, he should hold firm rim of condom and withdraw from vagina.

- take off the condom. tie at other end and do not let semen spill. dispose off the condom properly.

- keep condoms in cool dry place and away from sun light.

- help people make individual choices about spacing methods.

- keep stock of condom and show how to use it, and make condom available.

if situation is suitable, you can show the couple how condom is used. use a flip chart and a condom piece. sometimes you will have to show it to the woman and ask her to share it with the man. you may use a banana (as a penis model) for demonstrating it.

many brands are available in market. some brands have a soft grainy surface to enhance pleasure. more expensive brands are also available in different colours and fragrance

some myths and misconceptions about condoms need to be answered. the misconceptions are: a) condoms reduce pleasure of sex b) a condom user is a promiscuous person.

the female condom is now available in cities. with this even women can use a condom. that is helpful when men are unwilling to put on condom. it empowers women in risky sex situations.


20  registration of pregnant women

in this lesson we will learn about  what are the major risks in pregnancy?  why it is necessary to get all pregnant women registered early? 

Pregnancies
childbirth is a natural event. however many women can suffer and die due to complications during pregnancy or delivery. any pregnancy can be dangerous for a mother. we can not foresee all these problems. treated in time, we can ensure safety of mother and child. regular check ups during pregnancy are necessary

anemia in pregnant women is a major contributor to mothers’ deaths. half the women have anemia. some of them are very pale. nurse will be able to detect anemia and provide treatment.

- swelling of feet, breathlessness, headaches, blurred vision and fits are serious complaints.

- severe pain in abdomen any time during pregnancy is risky and needs immediate attention.

- bleeding per vagina any time during pregnancy and after child birth is risky.

- continuous leaking of fluid from vagina can cause infections and premature birth.

- very young mother is likely to suffer several problems. she must have her childbirth in the chc or city hospital.

- dangers are present even during childbirth—bleeding, retention of placenta or lack of progress.

- sometimes placenta is retained after childbirth

- there may be high fever during pregnancy and after child birth.

Why registration
as said above any pregnancy can end up as a difficult and child birth. hence, it is important that all pregnancies are registered and good care is available to them.

registration will allow nursedidi to conduct regular checkups and talk to her on issues related to her own health and health of growing baby inside. encourage women to register themselves for anti natal care as soon as they are sure of pregnancy. a pregnancy test is available at phc or at other health facilities.

invariably one day is fixed at each anganwadi centre as health day. you should accompany pregnancy women especially from poor sections of community.

encourage women to follow advice given by nursedidi during pregnancy check ups.

every women need to undergo four checkups during pregnancy

you have tablets for prevention of anaemia in your drug kit. these tablets can be given to pregnant women, if she has not received from nursedidi.


21  janani suraksha yojana

in this lesson we will learn about janani suraksha yojana 
eligibility criteria for benefits
your role in janani suraksha yojana

jjaannaannii ssuurraakksshhaa yyoojjaannaa it has been estimated that nearly 1,20,000 women in india die each year due to pregnancy related complications. most of these deaths are preventable by timely management of complications during pregnancy, child birth and immediately after birth.

child birth is safer at a hospital equipped with all facilities to treat complications during pregnancy. many women deliver at home due to several reasons. also families find it difficult to arrange merely for transport and buying medicines or pay doctors fee etc.

government of india has started a new scheme janani suraksha yojana for women belonging to below poverty line (bpl). salient features of this scheme are as follows:

eligibility for jsy and cash awards

cash assistance to all women belonging to bpl families and attained 19 years age. women undergoing third live births are also eligible provided they undergo sterilisation

- rs. 700 are to be given to women

- rs. 600 cash assistance will be given to asha which will include transport costs and other expenses incurred during her stay with women at hospital

your role in janani suraksha yojana: 
- identify pregnant women from bpl families

- identify pregnant women from bpl families and get her registered with nursedidi.

- help pregnant women from poor families and get bpl card from gramsevak if she does not have it already.

- help women to receive at least 3 anc check ups and counsel for hospital delivery identify in advance place of delivery

- escort the mother to pre identified health centre and stay with her, till she is discharged

- register birth with panchayat or inform the nursedidi.

22 hiv and aids

in this lesson we will learn about
what are hiv and aids? what can we do to prevent its spread?


HIV is an infection
 hiv is a very minute germ. this germ hurts the very human defence system that fights all germs. hiv infection is detected with a blood test. a person having hiv germs in the blood is considered as hiv positive. infection cannot be identified without a blood test.

the germ hiv is passed on from one to the other person:

- through unprotected sexual intercourse with a person who is hiv positive.

- through blood transfusion when blood is taken from hiv positive individual.

- through contaminated needles used previously in a hiv positive person.

- from hiv positive pregnant woman to child during delivery or afterwards.

hiv is not passed on by 

- touching and kissing a person.

- just living together.

- playing, swimming together.

- using common bathrooms and toilets.


Risky sexual behaviour
the main cause of hiv aids spread is risky sexual behaviour. sex with multiple partners without condom is the risky sexual behaviour. men having sex with men also exposes them to risk of infection.

The window period
after exposure to risky situations, hiv test will be positive only after 6 12 weeks. this is the window period. so one has to wait for this period to get an hiv test.

in our country more than 85 percent of hiv transmissions take place through sexual route. there are not “high risk groups” but there are some people who have high risk behaviour. aids can strike anybody depending on your behaviour.

AIDS is the illness
aids is the illness due to hiv infection. this may take months and years after hiv test is positive. the person is infective in this period. aids is a serious disease without permanent cure. but now we have some medicines to reduce its severity. suggestive symptoms of aids

- continuous weight loss,

- persisting diarrhoea,

- repeated fever illness lasting more than one month.

- the minor features include chronic cough, itching, rash on body and genitals, oral thrush (fungal infection), buboes, and illnesses coming too often.

wwee ccaann pprreevveenntt aaiiddss prevention of hiv/aids is the only effective way of removing this deadly disease. following points are important.

creating awareness in community about risk causation and spread of hiv/aids and its seriousness.

advising men and women to avoid sex with multiple partners.

consistent and correct use of condoms prevent infection.

in some hospitals we have special services for pregnant women. this involves counseling, blood tests and provision drugs to hiv +ve mothers. this will reduce the risk of infection to the baby.

awareness among adolescent boys and girls about healthy family life including sex education is important

adolescents should have access to information as aids transmission and prevention. adolescent girls are vulnerable.

blood testing facilities are available at most district hospitals. here blood test for hiv/aids is done along with counseling services.


23  breast feeding

in this lesson we will learn about

the importance of breastfeeding a baby. basics of brestfeeding

Breast feeding - it is important to share this advice with mothers
immediate breast feeding within half an hour after birth is vital for the baby. it gives baby nutrition and immunity against illnesses. it shrinks the mother’s womb and reduce bleeding. milk flow is better with frequent suckling

breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. no other feeds including water are necessary. consult a nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeeding problem even after your help.

mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. on delivery the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. the baby should be fed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ attacks. this should not be thrown away

breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby. it also contains sufficient water for the baby’s needs. no need for feeding water separately. more the baby suckles, the more milk is produced.

it protects the baby from getting diarrhea and pneumonia.

breastfed babies normally feed every two hours. well fed babies sleep quietly for 2 3 hours, and gain weight normally.

breastfeeding menstrual cycle. hence many of them do not get pregnant soon. you will learn about contraceptive effects of breast feeding in the programme.

help for problems like cracked and sore nipples, painful breasts due to milk hold up. if the nipples are sunken the baby can not suckle well

mothers need to be reassured about their breastfeeding abilities and that baby gets adequate nutrition. breastfeeding can prevent more than 10 lacs child deaths each year. breastfeeding should be continued whenever possible for at least two years.


breastfeeding basics help the mother to breastfeed 
- clean the nipple of the breast with warm water before feed.

- hold the baby horizontal on the lap or besides if the mother is lying on side.

- hold the breast at the root of the nipple. put the baby's mouth to the breast. the baby gets a full hold of the nipple now. this is evident from the baby's upturned lips.

- make sure the baby's head and body is held facing the breast without turn and twist.

- support the baby’s head with one hand.

- clean the nipple after the baby leaves the breast.

- change the side for the next feed.

- for a cracked nipple help the mother to massage her breasts gently, applying turmeric with edible oil to nipples in such conditions. a plastic nipple is very useful in this situation.

for sunken nipples pull them out gently and often by hand. place a soft rubber nipple shield directly over the retracted or sore nipple for the baby to suck on. this helps the baby to breast feed. it also helps in bringing out the nipple.

clean the nipple shield thoroughly before and after every feeding.

some mothers get dribbling from the other breast if the baby is on one breast. but this is not a rule. no need to worry if dribbling is happening or not

Think about this

- often a baby is breastfed only after the third day. this starves the baby and affects the milk flow.

24 infant nutrition 

in this lesson we will learn about
foods for the baby after six months of exclusive breastfeeding.
eleven golden rules for child feeding.

child feeding practices after six months 
- after six months of only breast feeding, the baby needs extra food to grow. start one new food type at a time, not many.

- food like gruel, porridge, cooked vegetable, fruit pulp is good for babies after six months age. if top milk is given do not dilute it. dilute milk is often the cause of malnutrition


- prepare semi solid feeds from roasted, puffed grain, flour prepared from fermented grain (satva) are easy to digest.

- add oil or ghee to child's food to improve nutrition.



- eggs are a good source of body building element called proteins.


- babies and children need frequent feeds every day. child should be offered food every three to four hours.

- washing hands before preparing food and feeding child is essential.

- for older children (2 years) keep food ready and reachable for the child. the child should it eat whenever hungry e.g. roasted groundnuts and jaggery (gud) are popular.

- eggs, groundnut, soyabeans, fish are high protein foods. child growth is better with these feeds

- avoid market packed feeds (formula feeds) as they are costly and give false confidence to the parents.

- feed child gently, never use force.

Some other tips
while feeding with spoon place it on the middle of tongue to avoid spitting by the baby.

cleanliness has to be maintained while preparing the food of baby. maternal hygiene needs to be promoted.


some home recipes for child feeding children

rice and dal khichdi with ghee or oil 

porridge   semolina (suji / rawa), singhada, ragi flour, hyderabad mix (preparation of hyderabad mix   one katori rice, half katori chana dal, one forth katori ground nut to be roasted and powdered.)

cooked vegetables   spinach, pumpkin, carrots, potato, beans, tomato

fruit pulp of banana, papaya, apple, chikku, and mango

25  immunization
in this lesson we will learn about 
vaccines for six dangerous illnesses of childhood. 
importance of vit a doses 
to convince parents to take their children for immunization.

We should know this
 many serious germ diseases in children can be prevented by immunization vaccines

bcg prevents lung tb.

opv (polio dose) prevents polio.

dpt protects the child from diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.

measles vaccine prevents measles.

these vaccines are given free to all children by the nurse didi in your village. they are also given at the sub centers and the phc.

vaccines need cold storage during transportation to retain their power.

child gets fever after dpt injections. this can be treated with ‘paracetomol’ tablet or liquid.

bcg is usually injected on the baby’s left shoulder. a scar is formed six weeks after injection. it shows that the child may have become immune to lung tb.

give also five doses of vitamin a. start from nine months age, and give every six months. this protects children from night blindness. vit a also boosts child’s

we all know that many parents deny their children immunization. immunization boosts body’s fighting power against diseases caused by germs. you can help them by explaining benefits of immunization. accompany them during immunization services in village.


Schedule for immunization & Vit A:
<table><tr><td>BCG</td><td>At birth or any time up to one year</td></tr><tr><td>Polio - 0</td><td>At birth (if delivery is in institution)</td></tr><tr><td>Polio - 1+DPT</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Polio - 2+DPT</td><td>10 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Polio - 3+DPT</td><td>14 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Measles+ Vit A (1ml)</td><td>Nine months</td></tr><tr><td>1st Booster DPT &amp; Polio +Vit A 2ml</td><td>18 months</td></tr><tr><td>Vit A 2ml</td><td>24 months</td></tr><tr><td>Vit A 2ml</td><td>30 months</td></tr><tr><td>Vit A 2ml</td><td>36 months</td></tr></table>

if a child is not given the right vaccines in time, get them started whenever possible and complete the primary immunization before child reaches first birthday.

Make sure
immunization card is given for each child by the health worker and to be kept safely for further follow up. the child gets full immunization in time. parents should bring the child for immunization as per schedule. only complete immunization protects the child fully. partial immunization does not protect and gives false sense of protection.

some people have misconceptions about immunization. you need to dispel these. for instance some people feel that immunization is harmful to babies. or it causes fever and therefore illness. another misconception is that immunization should not be done if the child is sick. ask your nursedidi about questions raised by the parents about immunization.

26 diarrhoea 

in this lesson we will learn about 
what causes diarrhea. 
how diarrhea can be fatal? 
how severe is the dehydration. 
how can we save such children at home?


Why does diarrhea occur?
many children get diarrhea in your village. one or two among may have even died due to the illness. germs are the main cause of childhood diarrhea. these germs come from unsafe drinking water, unclean feeding practices, bottle feeds etc. we can avoid these problems with help of families and the village community.

What happens to child with diarrhea?
water makes up to 72 75 percent of children’s body weight. that makes life possible. what if we lose even some water? think of a plant without water. we have a pretty flower plant in our house. we forgot to water the plant. we know what would happen to it!


water loss can be fatal. whatever the germ of diarrhea, the dehydration is the cause of deaths. you have to act in time. let us understand the stages of water loss.

Rehydration
treatment of diarrhea is very easy and quite effective. the principle is to prevent dehydration.(loose motions may not stop for 2 3 days) water needs to be restored quickly. continue feeding. if child is breast feeding, it should continue

Severity of dehydration of child
<table><tr><td>Dehydration |</td><td>Child is</td><td>| Thirst</td><td>| Tongue and mouth</td><td>Eyes</td><td></td><td>Talu (AF)}</td><td>Skin fold on | pinching</td><td>Urine</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Alert, restless</td><td>present</td><td>| moist</td><td>| moist</td><td></td><td>normal</td><td>Normal, returns quickly</td><td>| normal</td></tr><tr><td>Mild Dehydration |</td><td>Restless, irritable</td><td>| present |</td><td>dry</td><td>Dry sunken</td><td>and</td><td>| sunken</td><td>Fold stays a | while</td><td>Little</td></tr><tr><td>Severe Dehydration |</td><td>Sleepy, | floppy |</td><td>Not drinking</td><td>dry</td><td>Dry sunken</td><td>and</td><td>| sunken |</td><td>Fold stays for long</td><td>| absent</td></tr></table>

Home available fluifs (HAF)
give the baby a lot of watery foods like ‘sharbat’, coconut water, rice kanji, light tea etc. you should talk about commonly available, locally accepted liquids which are given to children.

Oral rehydration salts (ORS)
 ors packets are available in your kit and with other health workers.

take one liter of water in a clean container. empty the full packet of ors in this. stir it. start giving this fluid spoon by spoon to the child. prepare fresh ors everyday.

other tips 
- mother/father or other care taker, should wash hand properly before feeding the baby. it should not give new infection.

- give ors spoon by spoon to avoid vomiting.

- if possible, use boiled water for preparing ors. at least make sure it is from safe sources.

- continue breastfeeding if the baby is breastfeeding.

- give other foods and drinks along with ors.

- bottle feeding is bad for any child. avoid it in diarrhea also

when to refer the child 

if dehydration is severe. (start fluids and then send)

- if the vomiting does not stop

- in case of convulsions

- if the child has fever.

- if the child gets blood in stools.

- refer the child to the phc/chc where facilities for admission are available. if possible, escort the family.

- this child may need fluids through bottles.

How to prevent diarrhea?
to prevent diarrhea keep the home and its surroundings clean. prepare the food in clean vessels and store in clean conditions. do not allow house flies to breed in neighboring places. wash hands before eating and after defecation with soap and water. never use food that is going spoilt. summer season hastens spoiling of food. a thumb rule, use freshly prepared food and within one hour.

we can do this identify children

- identify children with diarrhea.

- know the signs of dehydration.

- learn to prepare ors at home

- refer or accompany the child to hospital if seriously ill.

- discuss with people about cleanliness of home, while cooking and storing foods.

- discuss with them about not to stop feeding babies who have diarrhea.

- discuss with them about futility of injections, unless really needed.

what do you think about this? 

by knowing how to treat diarrhea you can save children’s death.

27  aches and pain

in this lesson we will learn about 
what are aches and pains? 
about body pains and internal pains. 
how to treat body aches and pains

Aches, pains, body pains and internal pains
aches and pain is one of the most common complaints. it is a signal that something is wrong inside the body or particular part having aches.

ache is a mild pain and we know of body ache, headache, backache etc

we can group pains and aches related to head, skin, muscles, bones, and joints, limbs etc as ‘body pains’. generally these are easy to treat.

the pains related to inside organs of chest, and abdomens are internal pains. you will refer all these problems to the doctor. we will learn about them in the next book.

we describe various types of pains: cutting, burning, pricking, stabbing, writhing, twisting, squeezing, throbbing, splitting, bursting, dragging, etc. these pains are specific to organs and underlying diseases.

many illnesses cause various pains. we can often find out an inner illness from the pain it causes. heart attack, stomach ulcer, urinary stone, appendicitis, menstrual pain, fractures etc are some examples. pains associated with concerns are also common

Pain relief
pain is only a symptom of some illness inside. we need to find out the illness and treat it whenever possible. many drugs are available for pain relief. for relief of internal pain organ specific remedies are available. here we will see only about body aches and pains.

headache, backache, body aches are often relieved with simple paracetomol tablet. for its dose please see last section

ayurveda suggests gentle oil massage for body aches and backaches.

acupressure suggests pressure points for many types of aches and pains.

drinking a lot of water can relieve burning pain occurring while passing urine.

good rest and sound sleep often relieve headaches and body aches

refer to a hospital
- any pain with convulsion

- chest or abdomen pain

- headache with neck stiffness

- headache of only half of head

- any pain associated with burn injury and in joints.

28. TB

in this lesson we will learn about 
cause of tuberculosis 
suspecting tuberculosis 
referral to health facility for diagnosis and treatment.


Understanding about tuberculosis
a minute germ causes tb. it spreads from one person to other through breath. a tb patient’s sputum has thousands of tb germs. also while coughing or sneezing the germs spread in the air. the germs also stay in dust for long and affect people. tb germs enter the lungs of nearby persons. in a weak person the germs survive and produce an illness. it may take months.

tb can affect any part of our body. but chest tb is the most important. it spreads from one person to other through air.

tb is serious illness. any one, rich or poor, adults’ male or female and children can suffer from tb. under immunity, nutrition, weak living overcrowding and poor conditions etc. help tuberculosis spread.

we have good drugs for tb today than we had before.

Suspecting TB
a person suffering from tb has one or more of these symptoms.

- the most common symptom of tb is cough lasting 3 or more weeks.

- sputum cough

- evening fever with sweating,

- the patient may also have chest pain.

- coughing up blood. (bloodspit)

however, the following four points are important for suspected tb cases.

- diagnosis needs checking patient's sputum under microscope.

- escort the patient to nearest CHC/PHC, where facilities are available

- no fees are charged for any tests or the treatment.

- aids patients can also have tb

Cure for TB
very effective cure for tb is available. one has to take the medicines in front of anm or mpw or any health provider. this is called directly observed treatment (dot). the improvement occurs in a few weeks. however, the full treatment takes 6 to 8 months in most cases. our rule is to make the patient complete the full treatment. you can also be a provider for dots treatment to tb patients in your village. try to get more information above dots treatment from nursedidi or male worker. during treatment the sputum is tested periodically for germs of tb. remember that services are available free!

some precautions 
- one should cover the mouth with handkerchief while coughing and

- sneezing. this halts spread of germs.

- one should take the medicines regularly. keep a follow up for this.

- persons having tb should avoid close contact with young children.

- children should get bcg vaccine in time that prevents serious forms of tb

We can do this
find persons who may be suffering from tb. look who is getting cough for more than 3 weeks. take the person to health center for sputum test. tell tb patients to take medicines regularly. encourage them to complete the treatment. tell people all tests and treatment is free at all government hospitals. even private doctors can arrange dots treatment.

inform people that bcg vaccine prevents tb. all children should get bcg vaccine as per national schedule.

educate patients to cover their mouth while coughing and sneezing. also tell them not to spit here and there.


29  snake bite

in this lesson we will learn about

how to identify poisonous bite

what is the correct first aid for snakebite?

Some useful information
most snakebites are non poisonous. snakebites are common in rainy seasons and night hours.

two fang marks are typical of a poisonous snakebite. look for fang marks. it is easy to know the 4 common poisonous snakes. cobra, krait, big viper and the small viper are the four main harmful snakes.

effective and quick first aid can save most patients. no magic or temple prayers can undo the poison bites. the 90% cases are saved because the bite was non poisonous. panic can also kill.

drooping eyes or bleeding are first signs of poison. drooping eyelids or sleepiness point to cobra and krait bites. bleeding from bite, gums, urine, in vomit means viper bite.

First aid in any snake bite
reassure the person and the family. tell them it may be non poisonous. make the person lie down and relax. do not make patient walk. . in case of non poisonous snake bite, it s enough to clean and disinfect the wound.

tie the entire limb with an elastic bandage. this slows blood flow from the limb. then tie a stick to the limb to lessen movement

shift to the nearest hospital. keep looking for poison signs of drooping or bleeding. take along the snake if it is brought killed. this helps in treatment. now specific anti snake venous infections are available. you should know about the hospitals where anti snake venom drugs are available in your area.

many people kill snakes indiscriminately. this is not good. snakes eats rodents which causes loss of our food grains. and many of them are non poisonous.

don'ts 
- do not waste valuable time in a temple or with a tantrik. remember even some tantriks have died due to snakebite.

- do not tie a tourniquet (single band string as was practiced till sometime ago). this causes the bite to bleed and may also stop blood flow to the limb. more than 2 hours to tight tourniquet can cause blackening and then loss of the limb.

- do not kill and waste chickens as some villagers do to treat snake bite.
