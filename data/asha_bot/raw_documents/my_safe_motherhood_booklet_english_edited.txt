###antenatal check up

get your hb, blood pressure(bp), urine, weight and abdomen checked at every visit. ensure that you receive ifa tablets and two doses of inj. tetanus toxoid (tt). always consult your mo if necessary or referred

● Get urine tested for albumin and sugar. detection of albumin and sugar saves you and your baby from serious conditions

assess anaemia. haemoglobin estimation helps in early detection and treatment of anaemia.

one tablet of ifa is to be taken daily starting from the fourth month of pregnancy. if you are anaemic, you will be advised to take two ifa tablets daily, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening

taking one ifa tablet a day keeps anaemia away in mothers and ensures delivery of a healthy baby

• exclusive breastfeeding should be done for six months and no prelacteal feeds (gripe water, honey) should be given to the baby during this time
• breastfeeding should be given on demand
• exclusive breastfeeding decreases the chances of diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections in the newborn; it decreases chances of pregnancy during that period
• mother’s milk is best for health and growth of your baby
•  give only breast feeds to your baby for six months and protect baby from illnesses like diarrhoea and others

###complementary feeding
any food given to the baby in addition to breast milk is called complementary foods. after the age of 6 months, breast milk is not enough for mental and physical growth of the baby so complementary feeding is essential.
