2.  tuberculosis 

tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. it occurs commonly in lungs but can occur in different parts of our body i.e. intestines, kidneys, bones etc. there may be about 15 to 25 confirmed cases of TB in your village. please ensure that all of them are identified and registered for treatment.

lung TB spreads by air. when a patient of TB coughs or sneezes, the bacteria enters the body of other persons who breathe that air. however, TB can spread to other parts of the body too. in women, TB of reproductive organs can cause infertility.


you can suspect a person of having tuberculosis if he/she has any of the following signs/symptoms:
- persistent cough for more than three weeks especially with sputum 
- low grade fever especially during evening 
- weight loss/fatigue
- loss of appetite
- occasional presence of blood in sputum
(haemoptysis)

in our community, old persons with all the above symptoms are generally neglected thinking that these are common symptoms of old age. but, whoever has the above symptoms should be suspected of having TB.

vulnerable situations 
- people with malnutrition 
- people living in crowded areas like slums etc. 
- people living in houses without proper ventilation 
- people living in environmentally polluted areas 
- people with hiv/aids 
- women and children are equally vulnerable

generally, all the poor are vulnerable as they have the maximum chances to fall into the above categories.

under the revised national tuberculosis control programme, the following services are available
- sputum of person having cough for more than three weeks is examined three times in microscopy centres. you should know the nearest microscopy centre. you may ask the ANM where they are so that you could guide a person to these places for sputum testing. 
- if sputum examination shows evidence of TB, anti  TB drugs are initiated. duration of treatment would be as per doctor’s advice ranging from six months to nine months. 
- in some cases, x ray may be necessary and if it is positive, anti TB drugs are given.

anti TB drugs are available at all district TB centres, TB clinics, government hospitals, district hospitals CHCs, PHCs etc. again you could check with the ANM for treatment of TB. directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) centres have been established. they provide treatment free of cost, which is given under the supervision of the local ANM, MPW etc. or through voluntary workers. you are also supposed to work for this programme as a DOTS provider in future. a separate training will be given to you so that you know how to provide services under this programme.

early detection and treatment 
- advising persons having the symptoms mentioned earlier, irrespective of age as well as people from the poorer sections to have their sputum examination done.
- ensuring that in your village all the persons who are on the treatment take complete course of drugs. 

as DOTS provider: as asha you are going to be one of the DOTS providers.
- you should know about the DOTS centre and other DOTS volunteers in your area.
- you need to know which medicine is to be given at what time etc. you may need to keep records of the cases that you are handling. you may ask your ANM/MPW or PHC doctor for giving training to you on these issues.
- as DOTS provider you need adequate stock of anti TB drugs for those patients looked after by you. request the TB centre to ensure this. 
- as DOTS provider you should known how much incentive is available and how and from whom you can get it

in prevention of TB 
- advise the patient/family about disinfection of sputum for stopping spread of disease. one of the useful methods is the deep burial of sputum.
- advise the people regarding prevention of TB: while coughing/sneezing, cover mouth and nose with hand/ handkerchief. not to spit indiscriminately. counsel them about their nutritional status, suggesting better and affordable options in terms of fulfilling their nutritional needs. immunize the child with bcg immediately at birth. advise all on clean habits/taking nutritious food, maintaining proper ventilation at home.

3. malaria

malaria is an illness caused by the presence of malarial parasite in the human body. it spreads through the bite of mosquito. when a mosquito bites a person suffering from malaria, the parasite enters the body of the mosquito. when the infected mosquito bites a healthy person then he/she may develop malaria.

a person with malaria generally has fever with chills daily/alternate day, generally with headache, bodyache and vomiting. the fever comes down with profuse sweating and leaves the person with generalized weakness and discomfort.

whenever a case of fever is seen without any other sign/symptom such as rash/diarrhoea/cough etc. always consider it to be malaria. give treatment on that basis

presumptive (inital) treatment for malaria fever
- it should be given to all fever cases if malaria is suspected after taking blood film wherever possible. 
- it should be given to all persons irrespective of age and sex including infants and pregnant women.
- this is done to destroy the malaria parasites in the blood and give relief to the person having malaria.
- certain cases of malaria can be life threatening and hence to have radical treatment after presumptive (initial) treatment is important
- anti malarial drugs should not be taken on empty stomach

national vector bone disease control programme 
the following anti malaria activities are undertaken by government health facilities: 
- blood sample of patient with fever is collected by the multi purpose worker (MPW)/ANM. thick and thin blood smear are made and confirmed for malaria parasite. 
- if found to be positive, the radical (final) treatment is given free of cost on doctor’s/health worker’s advice. the drugs given are chloroquine and primaquine.
- primaquine should not be given to infants and pregnant women

preventive measures
- elimination of waste water collection sources prevents breeding of mosquitoes.
- pouring burnt motor oils in stagnant water pools prevents breeding of mosquitoes.
- using mosquito nets/medicated bed nets while sleeping.
- fumigating the house with neem leaves and applying neem oil on uncovered parts of body.

your roles & responsibilities

early detection 
- ensuring that all fever cases get the blood smear examination done by the ANM/MPW
- help the health worker in tracking the fever cases in your village. help the community to access the health worker at the sub centre/village.
- treatment and referral to act as a depot holder for chloroquine. 
- as depot holder you should ensure enough stock of chloroquine, especially in the monsoon & following months.
- ensure that all smear positive patients get complete treatment by ANM/ MPW.
- sometimes malaria cases may be serious and to save the life of the patient you need to escort the patient to nearest health facility.
- serious malaria patients may have any of the following symptoms: patient is abnormally sleepy, difficult to wake or confused; patient is unable to stand or sit.

preventive measures:
- educate the community about the preventive measures as discussed earlier.

4.  wound care 

wound can be of two types

a. without bleeding : abrasions, small cuts etc. 
b. with bleeding.

any wound requires immediate care.

following steps should be taken for wound care 
- first clean the wound and the surrounding area with clean water. 
- use different cotton swabs for each cleaning.
- wipe away the dirt with cotton gently, but do not rub it. rubbing disturbs the clot and it can start bleeding again.
- make a rectangular pad using cotton between two layers of gauze. the diagonal of the rectangle should be one inch longer than the wound itself. ask your trainer to teach you to make this. 
- if the wound is dry, then it need not be opened.
- for sharp cuts, stitches may be needed. usually simple stitching of small injuries can be done at nearby health facility. such persons need to be sent to health facility.
- it is advised that all persons with wounds be given TT injection at the earliest at health facility.
- for bad wounds, give first level care and refer to health facilities

sometimes you may need to control bleeding 
- first, stop the bleeding. press the wound with gauze or a clean cloth if the bleeding doesn’t stop.
- clean the wound with cotton balls soaked in clean water. cotton swabs should be just about wet. if you have no cotton, soft clean cotton cloth from sari or dhoti will do. 
- if there is continuous bleeding from the wound then immediately refer to the nearest health facility.

using local and home remedies 
we have very good home remedies for wound care.
- application of ice on bleeding wound until the bleeding stops. 
- haldi in oil is an excellent anti septic. for abrasions and small cuts, application is enough. dressing is not required in such cases.
- aloe is a good wound healer and a natural dressing too. cut a piece of aloe across its length and of the wound size. put the raw cut side of aloe and tie it on the wound with cloth. replace aloe dressing everyday
- application of neem oil is a good substitute. for bigger wounds, you may put it on the dressing pad.
- raw papaya pieces can be an effective dressing. this is especially good for infected wounds.
- triphala powder pressed on the wound stops small bleeds and also works as an antiseptic. you can wash the wounds also with triphala kadha.

your role and responsibilities : 
- to stop bleeding by application of pressure on the wound. 
- refer all patients with continuous bleeding for stitches to nearest health facility.


5.  dog and other  animal bites 

dog and animal bites: will it be rabies? 
dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness, which is called rabies. this is an illness, which affects the brain. the victim fears water. this is due to severe spasm during swallowing. no cure is available for rabies. anti rabies vaccine (arv) immediately after the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. these vaccines are available in government hospitals.

not all dogs are rabid. germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs. some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. the infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. all infected animals finally die and may infect others in the meantime. controlling stray dogs is the key to prevent rabies. monkeys and other animals can also be infectious if they are rabid due to such bites

very effective and simple first aid for any dog bite is to: 
- wash the wound with soap and water thoroughly. this is most important. 
- do not disturb the wound. leave it open. tie a loose dressing and advise to consult doctor/other staff in hospital dog and other animal bites

how dangerous is the bite? 
people will ask you if the bite is dangerous. a bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. first symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear early within 10 days or more after the bite.

rabies infection is likely if a pet dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows any signs of rabies. even a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. each wound is important. we can decide the risk of exposure as follows:

mild: licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of suspect cattle.

moderate: licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds fewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and fingers.

severe: all bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms, fingers, face and head, lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds more than five, bites of wild animals

if the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as severe.

bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. the effect of ARV reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog bite, fresh vaccination is necessary.

rabies in dogs: abnormal behaviour 
identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. remember that there are two types of rabid dogs   the aggressive and the silent. the aggressive kind keep biting and attacking humans and animals. they may refuse feeds but bite at wood or iron objects. they look ferocious. there is profuse salivation.

usually rabid animals act strangely. sometimes they are sad, sometimes restless or irritable or attacking. their mouth dribbles and froths and this fluid is highly infectious

an originally aggressive dog may turn docile. the silent type languishes to death in neglected places. wild animals may look friendly and turn to habitations. in case there are such problems in your area these need to be addressed and gram panchayats have to play the key role.

immunizing dogs 
immunization of dogs is essential. the protection given by vaccines used in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. protection by newer vaccines lasts for one year. those who handle dogs also need immunization every six months. a common problem is whether to use the milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. the rabies germ is not reported in the milk of animals. it is completely destroyed by boiling, so milk of such animals is not harmful. however, the saliva of the animal will contain germs if infected by rabies. the key issue is to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals

your role and responsibilities : 
- wash the site of bite with soap and water thoroughly. 
- refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti rabies vaccine is available.
- advise people to get pet dogs vaccinated against rabies.

6.  burns: first aid 

burns are common injuries in india and women are the common victims.

in some cases, the pressure stove is the culprit. in others it can be gas leak from the cylinder.

children or women may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids — like milk, oil, dal, chai etc.

please note that some of the burn cases can be suicide attempts or attempt to murder. in any case, our priority should be to give first aid and take the person to hospital at the earliest. inform the doctor about any information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional. in case, you know, do let her know about NGOs or counsellors she can approach for help. as necessary, the doctors will initiate legal measures in these cases

common causes 
- kitchen accidents: commonly bursting of pressure stoves 
- fire crackers 
- explosion in work places 
- house fire
- chemical burns 
- electric burns 
- suicide attempts
- murder attempts

o

first aid and other help 
first try to put out the flames. the immediate first aid for all kinds of burns is to pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, except on acid burns. this helps to reduce damage by absorbing heat from the skin. it also reduces pain to some extent. water also helps by separating burning clothes from the skin.

many people wrongly believe that water causes blisters on the skin and instead they wrap the victim in blankets. this puts the fire off after some seconds, but does not absorb the heat. water is far more effective than a blanket because it cools instantly

if you are using water soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt part and change them every three minutes. help the victim to drink as much water as possible. this helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid loss from the body. cover the burns with a clean cloth to protect from dust, flies, etc. unless the burns are minor, all burn cases must be referred to hospitals. facial burns and burn in hands should be referred.

you may have to treat small burns at home. treat it like any other wound. herbal applications like neem oil, coconut oil, aloe or raw papaya dressings are good.

prevention of burns 
prevention is better than cure. think and start from your own home. synthetic clothes catch fire quite quickly. they stick to the skin more

easily. advise people to always take care regarding their clothes and sari pallus etc, during cooking.

over pumping the stove before pinning and igniting is dangerous. ‘first pin and then pump’ is the correct method to light the stove

your role and responsibilities: 
- pour plenty of cold water on the affected part 
- refer the patient to a hospital for further treatment 
- educate about safety measures specially while working with stoves

7. AYUSH

in this chapter some remedies for ayush systems of healing are spelt out. the knowledge about these remedies will be useful for ashas for their day to day work in community

iron deficiency disorders 
ayurveda has simple remedies to prevent iron deficiency anaemia. use of green leafy vegetables like spinach, punarnnava, sigru and fruits like amalki, dadim, dry grapes etc. in daily diet is important to prevent blood deficiency. ‘mandookparni’ fried in ghee is also indicated to increase the rbc. therapeutically, use of ‘punarnnavadi mandura’ with water or buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. anaemia in girls is a common cause for amenorrhoea. therapeutically use of ‘rajapravartini vati’ 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial in the condition. three gms. powder of equal quantity of black tila (sesame), shunti and ghritakumari (aloe) and one gm. jaggery with tepid water twice a day or decoction of above drugs including jaggery in the dose of 10  20 ml. twice a day is indicated for scanty menstruation. anaemia caused due to excessive bleeding during menstruation could be managed by the intake of ‘tanduliyaka’

aused due to excessive bleeding during menstruation could be managed by the intake of ‘tanduliyaka’ (rice wash) with iron preparations like ‘mandura bhasma’ 0.5 gm, or ‘punarnavadi mandura’ 0.5 gm and ‘shukti bhasma’ 0.5 gm. twice daily

homoeopathic medicines improve absorption and thereby help in iron intake as supplement or from food rich in iron. commonly used homoeopathic medicines for iron deficiency anaemia are given below with their indications.

- arsenic album: anaemia due to malaria, excessive prostration, oedema, violent and irregular palpitation.
- calcarea carbonicum: palpitation & tachycardia, vertigo, anorexia, nausea, eructation; pale, weak fatigue, lassitude, easily tired; headache and heaviness at morning, profuse sweating on head.
- china: chief remedy for anaemia resulting from loss of fluids, as in lactation or haemorrhage, or from all exhausting discharges, such as menstrual flow, long lasting diarrhoea.
- ferrum metallicum: paleness of the face and puffiness of the extremities, weakness, easily exhausted.
- ferrum phosphoricum: anaemia and chlorosis; it removes the underlying dyscrasia giving rise to the anaemic or chlorotic conditions and cures the trouble
- kali carbonicum: anaemia after loss of fluid or vitality; pallor; aversion to be alone; backache, weakness, profuse menses, irregular with clots, weak before menstruation; backache; vertigo.
- natrum muriaticum: anaemic and debilitated conditions due to loss of fluids, especially in women who suffer from menstrual disorders. phosphorus: anaemia; morning diarrhoea; restlessness; weakness and prostration; nervousness, debility and trembling; nausea and vomiting.
- pulsatilla: anaemic condition produced by large or continued doses of iron; system is relaxed and worn out; patient suffering from gastric and menstrual derangements.

some unani medicines are also commonly used for supplementing iron in pregnant ladies, mothers and children. sharbat e faulad 15ml. twice daily is indicated for pregnant ladies and mothers. in children the medicine could be given in the dose of 5 ml. twice daily. qurs e damvi two tablets with butter is also useful for this purpose

iron deficiency disorders can be managed as well as prevented by a proper intake of iron rich natural foods & the intake of foods, which enhances the absorption and utilization of iron from the intake of foodstuffs.


iron rich foods 
green leafy vegetables, spinach, ragi, jaggery, drumstick, dates raisins, amla and figs etc. for enhancing the absorption of iron, one must take whole grams, sprouts, fresh fruits and fresh raw vegetables. intake of tea, coffee and other preservatives in the food interfere in the absorption of iron. so by avoiding all the beverages, we can enhance the iron absorption

diseases of gastro intestinal system 
gastro intestinal system plays an important role in the normal and abnormal states of health. ayurveda describe that the use of wholesome diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man. food should be taken at proper time, when the body feels light after the digestion of previous meals, after the clearance of bowels and urine and when the mind is free from worries. clean and hygienic food should be taken in optimum quantity. the food should not be too hot or too cold, too heavy or too light

diseases of the gastro intestinal system are primarily caused by the food and water that we take. the root causes of many chronic diseases are also related to factors derived from partially digested or undigested food materials. therefore, the disorders arising from gastro intestinal tract should be promptly managed. if digestive capacity is low simple remedies like ‘trikatu’ and ‘panchakola’ powders 2 gms.twice daily are indicated for use along with warm water before meals. in abdominal pain due to indigestion, hinguvachadi churna, lashunadi vati, chitrakadi vati etc. is indicated in the dose of two tablets twice daily with warm water.

constipation is a common symptom of many illnesses, which can be managed by powder of ‘triphala’ (equal quantity of fruits of amla, harada and baheda) 5 gms. with tepid water at bedtime. 8 10 dried grapes of bigger variety boiled with about 250 ml. of milk is also indicated at bedtime for relieving constipation

unani medicines are widely used for the management of abdominal distension and gastritis. qurs-e-tankar or qurs-e-kabid is indicated one tablet twice daily in this condition. qurs-e-alkali one tablet twice daily may be used as an antacid. in non specific diarrhoea qurs-e-zaheer one tablet twice daily is useful. in case of amoebiasis qurs-e-deedau one tablet twice daily is indicated.
