ContentsAbout this book
The sixth and seventh modules cover areas whose content is already 
familiar to the ASHA. In addition, this module includes the development of speciﬁc competencies in healthcare for mothers and children. It is thus, intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.

 7Child Health & Nutrition
One-third of the world’s undernourished children live in India. About 46% 
of the children below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly one out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under nutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced w ork capacity
, and poor health and nutrition status 
through childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
Facts about Malnutrition in Young Children
• Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the 
contributory factors to over half of all child deaths.
• Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to 
spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they ﬁ  nd it more diﬃ   cult to get healthcare and also there is less time for child care. 
• Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using 
their scarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition. 
• Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in 
their homes. 
Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the 
grandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue. Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Communicate essential messages for prevention of malnutrition, advice on 
feeding and on prevention of illness, and on access to health and nutrition 
services. 
• Analyse the causes of malnutrition in a speciﬁ
 c child – the role of feeding 
practices, role of illnesses, of familial and economic factors and of access to services.
• Counsel families to prev
ent malnutrition and to reverse malnutrition in 
children below ﬁ  ve years.1. Infant and Young Child Feeding

8• It is easier to prevent a child from slipping into malnutrition than to 
reverse it once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on 
counselling every family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this time, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.
Recognising Malnutrition
It is diﬃ   cult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it is too late. Most children look normal but their height and w eight when 
measured is less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to w eigh 
every child monthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the child can be classiﬁ  ed as mild, moderate or servely underweight.
Sick children need special a�  ention. However, families of all children especially 
children below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent malnutrition.
Six Important Messages for Preventing Child Malnutrition
1. Exclusive Breastfeeding: Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; 
not ev
en water should be added. 
2. Complementary Feeding: At the age of six months, add other foods. 
Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least one to tw o y 
ears more. There are ﬁ  ve things to 
remember about complementary feeding:(i) Consistency: Initially the food has to be so�
  and mashed. But later, 
anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less spices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. ‘give daal not daal ka pani’.
(ii) Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one y
ear, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as the mother.
(iii) Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given should be equal 
to about half what the adult needs in terms of nutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has to be distributed into four to 
ﬁ 
ve, even six feeds per day . 
(iv) Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in v
olume, high in 
energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food . Family could add a 
spoon of it to ev ery roti/ev
ery meal. Whatever edible oil is available in 
the house is suﬃ   cient.
(v) Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the 
greener it is, or the more red it is the more its protective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, ﬁ  sh are liked by children and very nutritive and protective.   
3 Feeding during the illness:  Give as much as the child will take; do not 
reduce the quantity of food. 
A�  er the illness, to catch up with growth, add 
an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. 
Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 94 Prevent illness: Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are 
six important things to remember which could prevent illness:
(a) Handwashing:  before feeding the child, before preparing the child’ s 
food, and a�
 er cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the 
single most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea.
(b) Drinking water to be boiled . Though useful for everyone, it is of 
particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea. 
(c) Full immunisation of the child:  Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and 
measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that cause 
severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are more common and life threatening, than in normal children.
(d) Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month 
and then repeated once ev
ery six months till ﬁ  ve years of age. This too 
reduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in malnourished children.
(e
) Avoid persons with infections,  especially with a cough and cold picking 
u
p the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during 
the illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more rigorous in handwashing and more careful in handling the baby.
(f) Preventing Malaria:  In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under 
an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of malnutrition. 
You should encourage parents and other family members to spend time with 
the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the child. Such children eat and absorb food better.
5 Access to health services
 Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. 
On the very ﬁ  rst day of the illness, if you help the mother decide 
on whether it is a minor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be reﬀ  rered to a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.
 Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is 
less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a much higher chance of the children being malnourished. 
6 Access to anganwadi services
 The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the 
age of 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations. Malnourished children are to be giv en additional food 
supplements. For children below the age of tw
o, take – home rations ASHA Module 7

10Counselling on Malnutrition
All the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But 
there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, many of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not be possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps – ﬁ  rst an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding of this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.
For an analysis, we need to know the following:
• What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, 
moderately underw eight or sev
erely underweight?
• What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?
• What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been 
done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?
• What is the family’s access to the three key services? (ICDS, Health 
Services and Public Distribution Services)
Skill in Eliciting Information
There is a skill of asking each question so as to get the right information.
What the child is being fed
• Ask speciﬁ  cally what was fed in the last one day, starting from now and 
recalling backw ards, till the previous day
. 
Note
Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend 
to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary. are to be given. Even pregnant women and lactating mothers up to six 
months are entitled to get food supplements in the anganwadi centres.
 Weighing the baby and informing the family of the level of 
malnutrition is another important anganwadi service. 
 The anganwadi is also the site where the Village Health and Nutrition 
Day (VHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is giv en immunisation, V 
itamin A, paediatric iron tablets, 
Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) packets or drugs needed for illness management.Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 11
Things to notice: how many feedings in a day, how much in each feed, whether 
the child’s food included pulses, vegetables, oil.
• Ask speciﬁ
 cally about protective foods which are not given daily.
• Ask about feeding during illness. 
Illness and treatment
• Ask whether the child fell ill during past six months (ask speciﬁ  cally about 
di
arrhoea, fever, cold and cough). Start with most recent illness, and then 
ask them to recall backwards –“ before this when was he/she sick? etc.
• What actions did the family take during illness? Which provider did they 
go to? 
• What diﬃ
  culties did the family face in accessing healthcare and how 
much did it cost?
• What are the likely inessential services or expenditures which they are 
ge�
 ing into?
Access to anganwadi services • Is the child taken regularly every month to the Anganwadi Centre (AWC) 
for weighing? Hav 
e they seen the growth curve?
• Is the family availing of food supplements from the anganwadi, is it 
regular, reliable and of variety needed and reasonable quality?
Skill in Analysis 
Based upon the replies to these questions, you will form an understanding of the multiple causes of malnutrition in that speciﬁ  c child. It is never one factor, 
Given below are examples of understanding that ASHA formed 
in two children:
Banu was a nine month old girl with moderate malnutrition. She is being 
breastfed and only this month was started on complementary food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule.
Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, 
but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete. ASHA Module 7

12it is many. Do not jump immediately to some point 
and start giving your advice. Ask all the questions, listen to the replies fully, think about it and then only give your advice.
Discuss what measures are needed in each case and how this is to be convey
ed?
Skill of Counselling
How to give advice• First praise the mother for how well she is coping with the child and 
reinforce the good practices she is following. Praise must alw ays precede 
any other advice.
• Then deliv
er each message as needed for that child in the form of a 
suggestion and ask whether they could implement it. Dialogue with the family explaining why the step is needed and how they could achiev e 
it. If they are convinced, they w ould agree. If not convinced or unable to 
agree, mov
e on to the next message. It takes more than one visit and one 
dialogue for families to agree, even if it was possible.
• Then point out any harmful or wasteful practices, explaining why you 
say so. 
• Arrange for a follow-up visit to see how many practices hav
e changed and 
to further reinforce the messages. Each family with a malnourished child needs to be met about once or twice a month. 
• Arrange for mother and child to meet the 
ANM or the doctor as required. 
Such a visit is required in the following circumstances:
 Any child who is severely underweight. If, in addition, there are 
danger signs, admission in a facility which manages such children would be desirable. 
 Any child who is underweight, who does not gain weight even a�  er a 
few months of trying to follow the advice.
 Any child who is underweight, who has fever, or chronic cough or 
persistent anaemia.
Even if the family is not going to see the doctor or 
ANM, do inform the 
Anganwadi Worker (AWW) and the ANM so that they can follow-up too. This work is equally their work also. 
How you should NOT give advice
Do not prescribe advice without dialogue—just telling families what to do would not help…
Do not giv
e very broad and what can be perceived as ‘insulting’ advice like 
– “you must take care of your child, or you must keep the child clean, or you must give nutritious food etc.” 
Part A
Child Health & Nutrition 13Anaemia in the Young Child
Anaemia is important to diagnose because it commonly comes along with 
malnutrition. It may be a cause of poor appetite. Blood testing is essential, but even in its absence based on observ
ation of pallor alone, treatment can be 
started. 
Looking for Anaemia in Children
Unusual paleness (Pallor) of the skin of the soles or palms is a sign of anaemia.  
• T
o see if the child has anaemia, look at the skin of the child’s palm. Hold 
the child’s palm open by grasping it gently from side to side.
• Do not stretch the ﬁ  ngers backward. This may cause pallor. • Compare the child’s palm with your own palm and the palm of other 
children. If the skin is paler than of others, the child has pallor . 
Treatment for anaemia is to give one tablet of paediatric iron daily. And also 
give one tablet of Albendazole for deworming once in six months. For a child less than two years, give half a tablet of Albendazole (Refer Annexure 6). Iron rich foods as discussed for the mother (Book 6) are also needed for the y oung 
child. If anaemia does not improve, the child must be referred to a doctor for more complete blood tests and treatment.

14Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• Know signs of malnutrition in a sick child.
• Be able to classify grades of malnutrition. • Be able to plot weight for age on a growth chart. 2. Assessment of Malnutrition 
ALL sick children should be assessed for signs suggesting malnutrition.  
Check for Malnutrition
Look and Feel: 
• Look for visible severe wasting.
• Look for oedema of both feet.• Determine grade of malnutrition by plo�  ing weight for age (with AWW).
Identifying Visible Severe Wasting
• A child with visible severe wasting is very thin, has no fat, and looks like 
s
kin and bones. Some children are thin but do not have visible severe 
wasting. This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with 
visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and referral to a hospital .
• To look for visible severe wasting, remove the child’s clothes. Look for severe 
w
asting of the muscles of the shoulders, arms, bu�  ocks and legs. Look at the 
child from the side to see if the fat of the bu�  ocks is missing. When wasting is extreme, there are many folds of skin on the bu�  ocks and thigh. 
• The face of a child with visible sev ere w
 asting may still look normal. The 
child’s abdomen may be large or distended.
• Look and feel to determine if the child has sw elling of both feet. Use y our 
thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’ s foot when y 
ou li�   
your thumb.
Determine Grade of Malnutrition
The AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child. Every child in the village should be weighed and his/her w 
eight plo�  ed on the growth chart. 
There is a separate chart for boys and for girls under the age of ﬁ  ve years. 
How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition:• The le�   hand vertical line is the measure of the child’s weight.
• 
The bo�  om line of the chart shows the child’s age in months.
Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 152. Assessment of Malnutrition • Find the point on the chart where the line for the child’s weight meets the 
line for the child’s age.
Decide where the point is in relation to the curves:
• If the point is below the bo�  om most (-3SD) curve, the child is severely 
underweight.
•
 If the point is between 2nd and 3rd curve or exactly on the 3rd curve, the 
child is moderately underweight. 
• If the point is on or above the curve marked zero or between the curve 
zero and -2SD (second curve) or exactly on the 2nd curve, then the child is 
normal.
Community Level Care for a Malnourished Child 
All children who are underweight, should receive the following:
1. Nutritional counselling as discussed earlier 
2. Prompt treatment for all illnesses 
3. Periodic weight measurement to ensure weight gain and detect worsening 
early. 
(
a) De-worming tabs (Albendazole): Half tablet of albendazole for a child less 
than two y
ears old and one tablet for all children above two. 
(see Annexure-6) 
(b) Paediatric Iron and Folic Acid Tablets: Daily one for three months. 
(c) A dose of V itamin A: If this has not been given.
Remember: Those children who are moderately underweight, should 
be taken to a 24X7 PHC or higher facility for a medical consultation. Children who are sev erely malnourished need 
prompt hospitalisation in a centre which manages such children. This is o�  
en the District Hospital. ASHA Module 7

month and so on till the 60th month. 3. Update on  Immunisation
This session has already been covered in the ASHA Module 2. Thus, this is only a recapitulation.  
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Learn the skill of beneﬁ  ciary tracking: listing the names and knowing 
when the next dose is due.
• Learn the skill of ensuring that the child’
s immunisation record is 
updated.
• Learn which children are at risk of being excluded from the programme 
and how to ensure complete cov
erage. 
Role of ASHA in Immunisation
(a) Make a list of pregnant women, newborns and 
children up to two years eligible for diﬀ  erent vaccines.
(b) Visit all families once in six months  at least to update 
this list. A�  er every immunisation session (VHND) 
update both the village register and the child’s health card. Learn how to ﬁ  ll this village health register and child health card. You must be able to do this and teach this on your own. 
(c) Ensure that immunisation is discussed during every 
home visit in homes where there is a child under one year of age.Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 19(d) Remind mother when the immunisation is due and 
alert her to the date when the VHND is being held.
(e) If needed, escort the mother and baby to the 
VHND on the date when the v
accine is due. 
This is important for families who do not access 
services such as those from poor and marginalised communities.
(f) 
Ensure that ﬁ  rst dose of BCG and oral polio is given 
soon a�  er the baby is born.
(g) Mobilising children for VHND:
(i) Find out from the ANM when her next visit is due. If ASHA has her 
mobile number, conﬁ  rm it on previous or same day. 
(ii) You must ensure that poorest and most distant households receives 
special a�  ention to access the service.
(iii) Some children are more likely to be le�   out than others. This includes 
physically or mentally challenged children, children of migrant families, children belonging to families considered of ‘low er status’ 
 
or diﬀ  erent from the majority of the village. Such children and such families are said to be ‘marginalised’. They need your special a�  ention and assistance.
(iv) Some hamlets or urban slums/basti hav
e neither ANM or Anganwadi 
centre/worker taking care of their health needs. As an immediate step to address the issue. This needs to be corrected. As an immediate step, a women representative of the hamlet/slum can be included into the ‘village health and sanitation commi�  ee’. 
(v) The village health plan should help identify hamlets and communities 
that are under-serviced. We will learn about village health plans in a later module.

204. Assessing the Sick Child
Common illnesses in the young child could include: diarrhoea, cough and 
cold, and fever. Each of these conditions will be discussed in the following chapters. However, before you begin to learn about each speciﬁ  c illness, you need to know about the danger signs in a child.  
What are danger signs?
Danger signs indicate serious illness. These can occur in many illnesses. Some danger signs may occur without any relationship to the type of illness. For example fev er
, diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis or malaria can all produce 
lethargy or unconsciousness. These illnesses can also make the child so sick that the child is not able to drink any ﬂ  
uids. These are called general danger 
signs. The presence of ev en one general danger sign is enough to indicate 
a sev
ere disease. A danger sign calls for immediate referral. Where signs of 
common illness like cold and cough, fever, and diarrhoea are present without any of the danger signs, and where there is no doctor, you could provide some home-based care to the child and keep a watch for signs that indicate the need for referral. 
What are the questions to be asked when seeing a sick child?
Every child who is seen for an illness should be checked for the presence of the following general danger signs: • Not able to drink or breastfeed
• 
Vomits everything
• Has convulsions• Is lethargic or unconscious.
How to assess a sick child for danger signs?
Step 1: ASK: Is the child able to drink or breastfeed?   A child has the sign “not able to drink or breastfeed” if the child is not able to suck or swallow when oﬀ
 ered a drink or breast milk.  If 
the mother says that the child is not able to drink or breastfeed, ask her to describe what happens when she oﬀ  
ers the child something to drink. For Objectives of the session  
By
 the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• How to identify general danger signs among sick children.
• Be able to recognise symptoms of common illnesses. 
• 
Enable prompt referral.
Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 21example, is the child able to take ﬂ  uid into his mouth and swallow it? If you 
are not sure about the mother’s answer, ask her to oﬀ  er the child a drink of clean water or breast milk. Look to see if the child is swallowing the water or breast milk. A child who is breastfed may have diﬃ   culty sucking when his nose is blocked. If the child’s nose is blocked, clear it. If the child can breastfeed a�  er his nose is cleared, the child does not have the danger sign. 
Step 2: ASK : Does the child vomit everything?
A child who is not able to hold anything down at all has the sign “vomits everything.” What goes down comes back up. 
A child who vomits 
everything will not be able to hold down food, ﬂ  uids or oral drugs. A child who vomits several times but can hold down some ﬂ  uids does not have this general danger sign.
Step 3: ASK: Has the child had convulsions?
Ask the mother questions on whether the child has suﬀ 
ered from convulsions (local term) or not. 
Step 4: LOOK: See if the child is lethargic or unconscious.The lethargic child is sleepy when the child should be awake. A child who stares blankly and does not appear to notice what is happening around is also lethargic.
The unconscious child does not w aken at all. This child does not respond to 
touch, loud noise or pain.
Step 5: Ensure that the child is referred to a PHC/CHC immediately.
Remember: 
•  All sick children must be assessed for general danger 
signs.
• A child who has even one general danger sign has a 
severe problem. Refer this child urgently to hospital. 
• Complete the rest of the assessment and any pre-referral 
treatment immediately so that referral is not delay ed.
If child has diarrhoea, cough and/or cold, or fev er
, without any of the 
danger signs, the next three chapters describe how to proceed.ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
22Fever is a common problem among young children. A child with fever may have 
malaria or another disease such as simple cough or cold or other viral infection. 
ASK: Does the child have fever? 
Ask the mother if the child has fever. To check temperature, place the thermometer in the armpit for 2 minutes.  
If you do not have a thermometer, place your hand 
on the tummy of the child to decide if the child feels hot to touch. 
Fever is present if the mother is sure that her child 
has had fever, measured by the thermometer, or if you have determined that the child feels hot to touch.5. Assessing and Classifying Fever
ASK: For how long? If more than seven days, has fever 
been present every day? 
Ask the mother how long the child has had fever. If the fever 
has been present every day for more than seven days, refer this child for further assessment. 
LOOK or FEEL for stiff neck. 
A child with fever and stiﬀ   neck may have meningitis. A child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to a hospital. 
Wh
ile you talk with the mother during the assessment, look 
to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks 
around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiﬀ   neck. 
If you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw 
the child’s a�  ention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a ﬂ  ashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes. Objectives of the Session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• How to assess the child for fever. 
• Identify signs for which urgent referral is required.• Start the ﬁ  rst line of treatment before referral.

24Prevention of Diarrhoea
Good hygiene practices and use of safe drinking 
water also protect against diarrhoea. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water a�  er defecating and a�  er contact with faeces, and before touching or preparing food or feeding children.  
To prev
ent diarrhoea, all faeces, including those 
of infants and young children, should be disposed of in a latrine or toilet or 
buried.  If there is no toilet or latrine, adults and children should defecate away from houses, paths, w
ater supplies and places where children play.   
Faeces should then be buried under a layer of soil. Human and animal faeces should be kept away from water sources. In communities without toilets or latrines, the community should consider joining together to build such facilities. Households can be encouraged to build their own toilet.
Step 1: Identifying the nature of diarrhoea
• Duration: Ask the mother if her child has diarrhoea. P
 assing stools more 
than three times a day is diarrhoea. Usually it is watery. 
• If the mother says the child has diarrhoea: Ask for how long the child has 
h
ad diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is of 14 days or more duration, the child has 
severe persistent diarrhoea . This child should be referred to hospital. 
• Passing Blood:  Ask if there is blood in the stools. The child who is passing 
b
lood in the stools has dysentery . This child also needs referral. But one 
can start treatment at home also, especially if the access to a doctor is not immediately possible. The child should be treated with Cotrimoxazole at home (dosage as Annexure 6) and the mother should be advised home care.
Step 2: Assess every child with diarrhoea for dehydration. • Look at the child’s general condition. Is the child lethargic or unconscious? 
Is the child restless and irritable? 
• Look for sunken ey es.6. Management of Diarrhoeal Disease
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• Be able to diagnose dehydration and ascertain if referral is required.
• Learn the skill of preparing and demonstrating ORS use to the mother/caregiver.• Learn the skill of counselling the mother for feeding during diarrhoeal episode.

Child Health & Nutrition
 25• Ask the mother to oﬀ  er the child some water in a cup or spoon. Watch 
the child drink. Is the child not able to drink or is drinking poorly? Is the 
drinking eagerly , thirsty?
•
 A child is not able to drink  if he is not able to suck or swallow when 
oﬀ
 ered a drink. A child may not be able to drink because he is lethargic or 
unconscious. 
• A child is drinking poorly  if the child is weak and cannot drink without 
help. He may be able to sw
allow only if ﬂ  uid is put in his mouth.
• A child has the sign drinking eagerly, thirsty  if it is clear that the child 
wants to drink. Look to see if the child reaches out for the cup or spoon 
when y
ou oﬀ  er him water. When the water is taken away, see if the child 
is unhappy because he wants to drink more.
• If the child takes a drink only with encouragement and does not w ant to 
drink more, he does not hav e the sign “drinking eagerly
, thirsty.”
• PINCH the skin of the abdomen. Does it go back: V ery slowly (longer than 
2 seconds)? Slowly?

Alternatively, one litre of water with 50 gm of sugar (8 spoons) and 5 gm (a teaspoon ) of salt. A juice of half a lime can be squeezed in. Taste to see that it is not too salty, or too sugary. It should taste of tears. Spoon is taken as 5 ml. Measure this amount and ensure it comes to 5 ml. Nowadays, one litre plastic water bo�  les are available and can be used to measure the correct quantity of water.

 27Plan A: If the child has diarrhoea but no dehydration: 
• If the child is still being breastfed, the mother is to be encouraged to 
continue breastfeeding, longer at each feed.
• If passing frequent w
atery stools:
For a child less than six months of age, give ORS and clean, preferably boiled 
water, in addition to breast milk. No other ﬂ  uid or food to be added.
If the child is older than six months and not being exclusively breastfed, give 
ORS solution and home available ﬂ  uids. Fluids that are available at home include soups, green coconut water, rice or pulse-based drinks, porridge, lime juice with salt and sugar. 
How much ORS to give?: In addition to the usual ﬂ  uid intake; give
 If the child is up to two months of age:” ﬁ  ve spoonfuls a�  er every 
loose stool
 If the child is more than two months of age and less than two years, 
give about half a cup a�  er every loose stool (100 ml).
 Older children can have up to one cup (200 ml) a�  er every stool.
Tips to help the mother:
 Give frequent small sips from the cup.
 If the child vomits, wait for 10 minutes.
 Then continue but more slowly.
 Continue giving extra ﬂ  uids until the diarrhoea stops. 
 Continue feeding/breastfeeding whenever the child wants.

 29Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:  
• Be able to diagnose ARI through measuring fever, observing chest 
indrawing, and breath counting.
• Be able to manage mild and moderate 
ARI with Contrimoxazole.
• Diagnose and refer the severe cases.
7. Management of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)
Step 1: Identifying the signs of ARI
Ask the mother if the child has cough or diﬃ   cult breathing.  If the mother 
says that the child has cough or diﬃ   cult breathing, ask for the duration. A child who has had cough, even if mild, for more than 30 days, needs to be referred to hospital for further assessment. Any cough with fever for more than three days should also be referred.
Step 2: Look for chest indrawing
Chest indrawing in a child with cough or diﬃ   cult breathing indicates that the child has pneumonia.
In
 a child less than one year, in normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper 
and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the young infant breathes IN. 
When chest indrawing is present, the lower chest wall goes IN when the young infant breathes IN. 
In children less than one year of age, mild chest indrawing can occur. But in 
children more than one year of age, mild chest indrawing is NOT normal. 
A child with any chest indrawing should be referred to the hospital.
Count the breaths in one minute.Count the breaths the child takes in one minute as 
ASHA has learnt earlier. 
Decide whether the child has normal breathing or fast breathing. 
Note: The child who is exactly 12 months old has fast breathing if you count 
40 breaths per minute or more.

Classify Cough or Difficult Breathing
Here is the classiﬁ  cation table for cough or diﬃ   cult breathing.
Signs/Symptoms Status Action to be taken
Any general danger 
sign orChest indrawingSevere Pneumonia or Very Severe Disease 
• Give first dose of Cotrimoxazole.
• Refer URGENTL Y to hospital.
Remember: 
•  A child with any danger sign or chest indrawing has 
SEVERE PNEUMONIA
 OR VERY SEVERE DISEASE 
and needs urgent referral to hospital.
• A child who has no general danger signs and no chest 
indrawing but has fast breathing has PNEUMONIA. 
This child should be treated with medicine at home.
• 
A child who has no general danger signs, no chest indrawing and 
no fast breathing has NO PNEUMONIA, COUGH OR
 COLD.. The 
mother of this child should be advised how to give home care. 
Skills Checklist: Counting Respirations
1. Wait for the child to be quiet and calm.
2. Remove your wrist watch and hold it in one hand, close to the baby’s 
abdomen.
3. Lift up the baby’s shirt so you can see the full breath; the abdomen rising 
and falling equals one breath.
4. Count the child’s breathing for one minute.5. 
Record the number of breaths in a minute.Part A

 31Fast breathing Pneumonia •  Give Cotrimoxazole for 5 days. (2 Paediatric tablets twice 
daily for a child from 2 up to 12 months and 3 tablets twice daily for a child from 12 months up to 5 years. 
• Follow-up in 2 days.
  If improving, advise home care and tablets to continue.
  If no improvement, insist on referral.
No signs of pneumonia or very severe diseaseCough or Cold
• Advise home care for cough or cold. 
•  If coughing for more than 30 days, refer for assessment.
Home Management for Common Cold or Cough
• Keep the young child warm and away from the draught.
• If the child’s nose is blocked and this is interfering with feeding, clean the 
nose by pu�  ing in nose drops (boiled and cooled glass of water mixed 
with pinch of salt) and by cleaning the nose with a so�   co�  on wick.
• Breastfeed frequently and for longer period at each feed. Exclusively 
breastfeed for six months.
• Child should continue to be giv
en normal diet during cough and cold. 
This is important as this will prevent malnutrition and also help the child to recover from illness.
• In case the child is not able to take the normal quantities of food, s/he 
should be given small quantities of food frequently.
• Child can also be given foods of thicker consistency such as khichari, 
dalia, sooji or rice in milk, idli etc..
• 
Small quantities of oil/ghee should be added to the food to provide extra 
energy. 
• A�  er the illness, at least one extra meal should be given to the child for at 
least a week to help the child in speedy recovery.
• Give increased amounts of ﬂ  uids.
• Give extra ﬂ  uids (as much as the child will take), such as dal soup, 
vegetable soup, plain clean water or other locally available ﬂ  uids. 
• Always feed from a cup or spoon. Never use a bo�  le.For babies over six months of age, soothe the throat and relieve the cough 
with a safe home-made cough remedy (made into a tea) such as:
Give Cotrimoxazole for 5 days. (2 Paediatric tablets twice 
daily for a child from 2 up to 12 months and 3 tablets twice 
daily for a child from 12 months up to 5 years. 
If improving, advise home care and tablets to continue.
If no improvement, insist on referral.
Advise home care for cough or cold. 
If coughing for more than 30 days, refer for assessment.
Note: If the child is sleeping and has cough or difficult breathing, count the 
number of breaths first before you try to wake the child.PART B

1. Safe Abortion1
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Be able to advise on method, based on duration of pregnancy.• Understand the risks of unsafe abortions, and know where safe abortion 
services are available in her area.
• Help women in need of such services to access safe abortion services.• Be able to identify signs of post abortal complications and advise 
appropriate referral.
• Counsel for appropriate contraception a�
 er the abortion.
A woman seeks abortion because:
• She does not want more children and has not used a contraceptive method 
properly or the method failed.
• A
 pregnancy can endanger her life. 
• She has no partner who will help support child. • She got pregnant a�  er rape. • The child will be born with serious birth defects.
When a woman is faced with an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to 
get a safe abortion.
Legality: In India, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks. They are legal only if 
done by a qualiﬁ  
ed practitioner. Up to 12 weeks, one doctor can do it. A�  er 
12 weeks, two doctors need to sign the consent form. Abortion services are free in all government hospitals. Women over 18 do not need anyone else to sign a consent form.
1  This chapter has been covered in Books 2 and 3, and is intended to serve as a refresher. 
ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
36Safety: Abortion is very safe if done by an experienced health worker. In India, 
only a doctor can perform an abortion, and this should be done under clean conditions, and with proper instruments. 
Ab
ortion is o�  en diﬃ   cult to get because, there are not enough service providers 
and facilities. Those providers who do provide abortion services may charge a 
lot of money or not even be legal providers of safe abortion services. 
If you are helping someone decide about an abortion
She needs respectful advice and friendly support. Do not tell anyone else, not even her family members, about her decision unless she wants others to know.
Abortion is unsafe when it is done:
• By someone who has not been trained to do it.
• With the wrong instruments or medicines.• Under unclean conditions.The later in pregnancy the abortion is undertaken, the more risky it becomes. 
Methods: All these methods can only be done by a trained, 
legal provider
• Medical Abortion: This can be done only in very early pregnancies less 
than seven w
eeks or 49 days a�  er last missed period. The woman is 
advised to take tablets, but this should be prescribed by and supervised by 
a legal provider . 
•
 Manual V acuum Aspiration:  This 
method involv
es the woman staying in 
the health facility for a few hours. It can be done up to eight w eeks of pregnancy 
. 
• Dilatation and cure�  age (D and C):  This 
method can be done up to 12 weeks of 
pregnancy
. It is associated with a higher risk of complications. 
Post-abortion care
You should advise women• To avoid sex or pu�  ing anything in the vagina for at least ﬁ  ve days a�  er the 
abortion. 
•
 Drink plenty of ﬂ  uids for faster recovery. 
• Some bleeding from v agina for up to tw o weeks is normal, but it should be 
light. Next monthly period will be a�  er 4-6 weeks. 
• That the risk of pregnancy exists as soon as intercourse is resumed regardless 
o
f monthly period. Th erefore a contraceptive should be used.

 39Women’s Needs for Family Planning
Diﬀ  erent women and couples have diﬀ  erent needs for contraception. When 
you counsel a woman on family planning, you should keep in mind the following: 
• Marital status: 
 
 Unmarried: condoms or pills or emergency pills 
  Newly married and wanting to delay the ﬁ  rst child: condoms or pills
• Just deliv ered (postpartum) or just had an abortion (post-abortal): 
condoms, pills, IUCD (a�
 er six weeks), injectables  (currently not available 
in the public sector, but being used in the private sector)
• Wanting to space children: condoms, pills, IUCD, injectables.
• Not wanting more children: Long acting (10) IUCD and sterilisation for 
the man or the w
oman.
Types of Family Planning Methods and Information on Side-Effects 
The Pill
If a woman takes birth control pills every day, pills will protect her from pregnancy for the entire monthly cycle. These pills are called Mala N or Mala D. Pills should be provided to those women who are speciﬁ  cally advised by the doctor . How
ever, since you are required to dispense these, it is important 
for you to know a few important facts. 
Taking pills may be dangerous for women with the following signs:
• Woman has jaundice, recognised by yellow skin and eyes.
• Woman has ever had signs of a stroke, paralysis or heart disease.• Woman has ever had a blood clot in the veins of her legs. • If the woman smokes and is over 35 years old. • Has high blood pressure (more than 140/90). If the woman has any of the problems listed above, the doctor would then 
counsel her to use a method other than the pills. 
Side-effects of pills
The pills contain the same chemicals that a woman’s body makes when she is pregnant. So she may hav e the following side-eﬀ
 ects:
• Nausea
• Headaches• Swelling of legs• Changes in monthly period.Side-eﬀ  ects o�  en get be�  er a�  er the ﬁ  rst 2 or 3 months. If they do not, and 
they are annoying or worrying her, you should advise the woman to see an ANM or doctor.

40Pills should not be advised for women who are breastfeeding. 
OCP are available in your drug kit, and at the Sub-Centre, Primary Health 
Centre (PHC) and Community Health Centre (CHC). 
Emergency Contraceptive Pills
ASHA does not start women on a pill, but could provide follow-up once it is started. These are for emergency use, when the couple has not used a 
contraceptiv e and hav
e had unprotected sex. It can also be used in instances 
of rape, or accidental breaking of the condom. The woman must take the pill as soon as possible a�  er unprotected sex. The pills are eﬀ  ective within 12- 24 hours of intercourse. The pills will not work if the woman has already become pregnant from having sex more than three days earlier. These pills are available in your drug kit, at the Sub-Centre, PHC and CHC. These pills are to be used only as an emergency method and you should advise users to shi�   to regular methods of family planning.
Condom: The condom is a narrow bag of thin rubber that the man wears on 
his penis during sex. Because the man’s semen stays in the bag, the sperm cannot enter the w oman’
s body, and she cannot get pregnant. The condom is 
a useful device to be used as a contraceptive and to protect against Sexually Transmi�  ed Infections (STIs) and HIV. It is also useful for couples where the male is a migrant and returns home for short durations.
Men most o�  
en buy condoms from shops. Since you have a supply of 
condoms in your drug kit, women may feel more conﬁ  dent in approaching 
you to obtain condoms. 
The Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD, Copper-T, the Loop)
The IUCD is a small object or device that is inserted into the uterus and prevents the man’
s sperm from fertilising the woman’s egg. The IUCD can 
stay in the uterus for up to 10 years. The most common IUCDs are made of copper. 
Remember:
  A condom is to be used every time the woman has a 
sexual encounter to prevent from pregnancy, STIs and HIV. 
  A condom is to be used only once. A condom that has 
been used before is more likely to break.
  Condoms are to be kept in a cool, dry place away from 
sunlight. Condoms that are from old or torn package are more likely to break.
Part B
Women’s Reproductive Health 
 41Who should not use an IUCD?
You should not counsel IUCD use if the woman:
• Has never been pregnant.
• Has anaemia (Low Hb).
• Is in danger of ge�  
 ing a Sexually Transmi�  ed Infection. (This includes any 
woman who has more than one partner, or whose partner may have other 
sex partners.)
• Has ever had an infection in her tubes or uterus, or an infection a�  er 
giving birth or having an abortion. 
•
 Has had a pregnancy in her tubes.
• Has a lot of bleeding and pain during monthly bleeding.
Common side-eﬀ  
ects: The woman  may have some light bleeding during the 
ﬁ 
rst week a�  er ge�  ing an IUCD. Some women also have longer, heavier and 
more painful monthly bleeding, but this usually stops a�  er the ﬁ  rst three 
months.
Who should insert an IUCD: An IUCD must be inserted by a trained 
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), nurse or a doctor a�  
er doing a pelvic 
(internal) examination. The best time to have the IUCD inserted is during the 
monthly bleeding/period. A�  er childbirth, it is best to wait six weeks for the uterus to return to its normal size and shape before ge�  ing an IUCD.
What to watch for: Occasionally an IUCD will slip out of place. If this 
happens, it will not be eﬀ  
ective in preventing pregnancy, so it is important for 
the woman to learn to check her IUCD to make sure it is still in place. Most IUCDs have 2 thread-like strings a�  ached which hang down into the vagina. The mother should be counselled to check the strings a�  er each monthly bleeding to make sure the IUCD is in place.
Teaching a woman to check the IUD strings
• Wash hands.
• Squat down and reach as far as she can into the vagina with two fingers. 
Feel for the IUD strings, but do not pull them.
• Take fingers out and wash her hands again.
Sterilisation (the operation when the couple wants no 
more children)
• Since these operations are permanent, they are only good 
for those women or men who are certain that they do not 
w
ant any more children.ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
42• To have one of these operations, the woman must go to a PHC or CHC. 
The surgery is fast and safe, and does not cause side-eﬀ
 ects. 
• The services for sterilisation are provided on certain days in these centres. 
You must know the nearest site where this service is av
ailable and on 
what days. 
• When needed, the ASHA  could accompany the woman to the facility for 
the tubectomy procedure. O�  en because of the case overload, quality of 
services is not assured and the ASHA should help the woman receive good quality care. Accompanying is desirable, but not mendatory.
The operation for the man (Vasectomy)A vasectomy is a simple operation, with only a small puncture to block the tubes that carry the sperm. It takes only a few minutes to do. The operation does not change a man’s ability to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure. He still ejaculates semen but there are no sperm in the semen. The couple must be advised to use condoms or other contraceptiv es for 90 days following 
v
asectomy. 
The operation for the woman (Tubectomy) A tubal ligation is a slightly more diﬃ   cult operation than a vasectomy
, but it is still very safe. It takes about 30 minutes. 
A trained doctor makes a small cut in the woman’s abdomen, and then cuts or ties the tubes that carry the egg to the womb. The woman can have the operation within seven days of the start of the menstrual cycle, 24 hours a�  er delivery, or six weeks a�  er the delivery. 
Important 
Sterilisation and pills do not protect against STIs and Human Immuno-deficiency 
Virus (HIV). So, for protection from STIs and HIV, a condom should be used during every sexual intercourse, if the woman is at risk of contracting them. Part B

443. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and 
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Objective of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Understand RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS
3; prevention, management and 
treatment.
• Be able to counsel w omen on protection from RTI/STI and HIV/AIDS.
•
 Be able to guide w omen to appropriate facilities for testing and treatment.
3  This section has also been covered in Book 3. Thus, this session is expected to serve as a 
refresher course. Is white discharge normal?
• Some amount of white discharge is normal. It is the vagina’ s way of 
cleansing itself. 
• The amount of discharge v aries during diﬀ  erent phases of the menstrual 
cycle. During the fertile period it is wet and slippery, and clear. 
• During pregnancy , the discharge increases in amount.
•
 Discharge that is bad smelling (smell of menstrual blood, ﬁ  shy odour), 
white lumpy discharge (curd, coloured greenish, yellowish, reddish, 
bloody), accompanied by itching, a rash, sores, burning urination, and lower abdominal pain, pain during intercourse is indicativ
e of RTI or STI. 
• A change in colour and odour is an alert to the women of a possible 
infection. In addition, if there is itching or burning, there is high possibility of an infection. 
•
 Discharge is also indicativ e of certain hormonal problems or ev en cancer.
What are STIs? 
STIs are infections that are passed from an infected person to another during 
sexual intercourse. Mothers can pass on STIs to babies during the deliv ery 
process. 
Most STIs are RTIs. However a few like Hepatitis-B and HIV are STIs but not 
RTIs. Many Reproductiv e T
ract Infections are Sexually Transmi�  ed Infections. 
However many other Reproductive Tract Infections are contracted by other means e.g. post childbirth or abortion or from GI infections. 
Why are STIs serious problem for women? 
• Because the infected semen stays longer inside a women’ s body. 
• The entire genital tract in w omen is hidden, therefore, the infection stays 
inside for a longer time and is silent for longer
.
Part B
Women’s Reproductive Health 
 45• It is harder for a woman to protect herself from STIs, because she is o�  en 
unable to negotiate with the male partner to use a condom.
What are the consequences of STIs?
STIs can cause: 
• infertility in men and w omen; 
•
 babies to be born too early , too small or blind; and 
•
 long lasting pain in low er abdomen, or ev en cancer.
• Death from sev ere infection or AIDS
What are the signs of RTIs?
Signs of RTIs include:• Abnormal discharge 
• Lower abdominal pain 
•
 Rash, Sw elling in the groin or sore in genital area. 
How
ever, these signs manifest very late. It is best to be aware that a woman 
can be at risk for an STI if:
• Husband has signs of an STI.
• Either the man or w oman has more than one sexual partner . 
• In some occupations which require long period of trav el and where the 
men engage in casual sex. 
Tasks for ASHA to be involved in are:
• Counsel women at risk on prev entive measures.
• Counsel w omen with symptoms of RTI/STI to go to the health facility for 
treatment. 
All 24X7 PHCs or higher facilities are equipped and skilled to 
provide necessary care.
• Take the course of medicine fully (all courses are for a week or ten days). 
Y
ou should motivate the woman to complete the course of medicines. Not 
completing the course of medicines makes the bacteria resistant and can cause a w orse infection that does not respond to drugs the next time.
•
 Ensure that the husband also gets treated.
• Counsel a w omen to abstain from sexual activity during the period of 
treatment.
• If the husband is known to indulge in extra-marital relationships, counsel 
the woman to av
oid having unprotected sex.
Where to get treatment for RTI/STI
• All drugs for STI treatment are available free of cost from PHC upwards.
• ANM and the PHC doctor can provide treatment.ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
46• Medicines should also be provided for the partner. 
• If repeated STIs occur, testing can be done at District Hospital for Below 
Poverty people Line (BPL), free for others.
HIV and AIDS
You can increase awareness on HIV and AIDS: On its transmission, its 
prevention and services available. You can also help in reducing myths and misconception as well as stigma and discrimination associated with it. Know the following:
• HIV is transmi�  ed through: a) having unprotected sex (sex without condom); 
b
) receiving HIV infected blood or blood products; c) using/sharing 
unsterilised needles or lancets; and d) from HIV infected mother to her baby. 
• It does not spread through any other mode such as kissing and touching, 
holding hands, mosquito bites, sharing clothes, or through saliv a, nose 
ﬂ 
uids, tears. 
• Who is at higher risk: Commercial Sex W orkers (CSWs), Injecting Drug 
Users (IDUs), Men who hav
e Sex with Men (MSM), migrant labourers, 
persons with multiple sexual partners, babies born to mothers who are HIV 
infected, and persons with other STIs. 
• Persons with HIV are at greater risk of ge�  ing Tuberculosis. Every 1 in 20 
persons suﬀ
 ering from TB in India is also HIV infected. 
• HIV can be prev ented by using condom during sexual intercourse 
(protected sex), using safe blood (when blood transfusions are necessary) from blood bank of gov ernment hospitals or recognised hospitals only 
, 
using sterilised needles/avoid sharing of needles, and by avoiding sex with multiple partners. 
• HIV testing and management facility is av ailable in the District Hospital free 
of cost. T
reatment services for AIDS are available in some district hospitals 
or in the main government hospital in the big cities. 
• You should encourage persons at high risk to go for HIV test. If w omen who 
are at high risk become pregnant, they must be motiv
ated to gets tested, 
as timely treatment may prevent transmission of HIV from HIV infected mother to baby. 
For cure of STIs, medicines are necessary, but for relief you could 
advice the woman to: 
• Sit in a pan of clean, warm water for 15 minutes. Add lemon juice to the water.
• Do not have sex until she feels better.
• Try to wear cotton next to the skin.
• Wash undergarments every day.
• Pour clean water on genitals after passing urine.PART C

1. High Risk Assessment and Management of Low Birth 
Weight/Pre-Term Babies
Identifying a high risk baby and what to do?
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Diagnose which babies are at high risk.
• Diagnose and refer high risk children.
• Counsel the mother on how to breastfeed a pre-term/Low Birth W eight 
(LBW) newborn.
•
 Teach mothers to express milk and feed such babies using a bowl 
or spoon.
Guidelines for ASHA on identifying a high risk baby
• Birth weight less than 2000 gm.
• Pre-term (delivery which happens when mother is 8 months and 14 days 
pregnant or less).
• Baby not taking feeds on Day 1.
If y
ou were not present at the time of delivery and your ﬁ  rst visit to the 
newborn is delayed, then the newborn is to be weighed on the day of your 
ﬁ  rst visit. In such cases, using the following table, determine whether the baby is high risk or not:
Day on which baby is 
weighed for the first timeWeight of baby Diagnosis
1 to 14 days Less than 2 kg High Risk Baby
15 to 21 days Less than 2 kg 100 gm High Risk Baby
22 to 27 days Less than 2 kg 200 gm High Risk Baby
28th day Less than 2 kg 300 gm High Risk Baby
ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
50What should you do if the baby is at high risk?
• Increase the number of home visits a�  er delivery from 5 to 13. 
• A daily visit, if possible, for the ﬁ  rst week. 
•
 Once every three days until the baby is 28 days old, and if the baby is 
improving once on the 42nd day. 
• Weigh the babies on Day 7, 14, 21, 28. Babies who weigh less than 2300 
gm on the 28th day have a higher risk of dying. If the baby is not gaining 
weight, refer the baby to the hospital. 
• Explain the high risk issues to the parents and family (see box abov e).
• Provide speciﬁ  c care as per the problem but in general, keep the baby 
warm and breastfeed more o�  en every two hours.
• For poor breastfeeding, observ e the mother breastfeeding. Ensure proper 
latch on and positioning. Encourage the mother so that she is motiv ated 
to feed the baby w
ell. Counsel the mother that she should not give other 
liquids or feeds.
• If on Day 28 the w eight is less than 2300 gm or w eight gain in 28 days is 
less than 300 gm, then you should continue to visit once a week in the 
2nd month and take the weight every week. 
• Fill home visit form for high risk baby (See Annexe 1 for the form)Guidance that you should give to the family
• Keep the baby clothed from the very first day. In winter, cover the baby with a 
blanket.
• Do not bathe a baby until its weight is 2000 gm.
• Ensure that mother’s nails are cut and that her hands are washed every time the baby is breastfed.
• After returning from the toilet, all family members must wash their hands with soap before touching the baby.
• High risk babies should be breastfed after every two hours.
• If baby is not suckling milk, squeeze the breast milk in a small bowl and then feed the baby with a spoon.
• The weight of high risk babies should improve every week from second week. If this does not happen, counsel them to consult you.
• Ask them to call you immediately if the baby develops any of the following: All limbs become limp, stops feeding, has chest indrawing, has fever, and is cold to touch.
51 Part C
Newborn Health2. Breastfeeding Low Birth Weight/Pre-Term babies
Advantages of breast milk for LBW and pre-term Babies
• Has the right nutrients for the pre-term/LBW baby
• Pre-term babies need more protein and a mother who has deliv ered 
pre-term has more breast milk.
•
 Is easily digestible.
• Contains factors to ﬁ  ght infection (small babies are more vulnerable 
to disease).
• Breastfeeding keeps the baby close to the mother and therefore, w arm. 
This protects the pre-term baby from cold (Hypothermia), which can lead 
to infection.
Key Messages
For small babies who can suckle
• Try the underarm hold for more support or the alternate underarm hold.
• If sleeping, wake baby every 2-3 hours for breastfeeding by rubbing a 
damp cloth over its face.
For babies who are not able to suckle: 
• Babies less than 1500 gm may not be able to breastfeed in the beginning.
• Express milk by applying gentle pressure ov er entire breast and collect 
milk in a clean bowl.
•
 Express milk ev ery 2-3 hours to keep the milk supply up. 
•
 Put baby to breast and allow her to lick the nipple, and try to suckle.
• Once the baby is able to suckle, she should be put to the  breast as o�  en as 
possible to stimulate milk production.
• Continue feeding with the spoon as w ell until the baby is ge�  ing its milk 
requirements directly from the breast.
How much to give?
• For a LBW baby: For ﬁ  rst day 60 ml/kg body weight. 
• Add 20 ml/kg body w eight until baby is taking 200 ml per day .
• Divide the total into 8-12 feeds (ev ery 2-3 hours).
• Colostrum can be kept for up to 12 hours at room temperature.
• Mature milk (a�  er ﬁ  rst 72 hours) can be kept for 6-8 hours at room temperature.
• 
Continue until baby can be fully breastfed.

523. Asphyxia Diagnosis and Management
What is Asphyxia?
A baby having any one of the following symptoms at the time of birth is 
asphyxiated: 
• No cry
• Weak cry
• No breathing
• Weak breathing.
If a baby has asphyxia, it is an Emergency. A life can be saved or lost in these 
ﬁ  ve minutes. If you are present at the time of birth,  and there is no doctor or 
nurse, you should try to help to manage the baby
. However, in many such 
newborns, your eﬀ  orts may not make enough diﬀ  erence and you should not feel bad or blame yourself for this. Depending on the area in which you work, you may be trained in using a bag and mask to treat asphyxia as in Annexe 3.
Consequences of Asphyxia 
Immediate (at birth)• Baby is born dead (stillbirth)
• Dies at once or within a few days
• Unable to suckle.
Long termIf the baby survives, it may have:
• Mental retardation
• Epilepsy (seizures and ﬁ  
 ts)
• Spasticity (diﬃ   culty walking or moving arms and hands).
These signs warn of asphyxia during labour
1. Prolonged or diﬃ   cult labour2. Ruptured membranes with li�  le ﬂ  uid (dry delivery)3. Green or yellow colour thick amniotic ﬂ  uid
Objective of the sessionBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Identify signs of asphyxia in the newborn.
• Support and if necessary , manage asphyxia in the newborn. 53Part C

544. Neonatal Sepsis: Diagnosis and Manage-
ment
How common is sepsis and how serious?
• In rural India, one out of every ten newborns 
develops sepsis. 
• Sepsis in the ﬁ  rst month of life is very serious, and is 
the most common killer of newborns in the ﬁ  rst month of life.
• Without treatment, many babies with sepsis will die; with treatment, most 
babies will get be�  er, live and grow up normally.
Causes of neonatal sepsis
• Mother has infection during pregnancy or delivery.
• Unclean techniques during delivery (poor handwashing, use of unclean 
blade or cord ties) can cause sepsis.
• Cord becomes infected from unclean cu�
 ing or pu�  ing dirty things on it
• Baby is weak; born pre-term or with LBW (less than 2000 gm)• Baby becomes weak from poor feeding practices; not giving breast milk 
early and exclusively.
• Baby becomes weak – exposed to the cold a�  er delivery.• Baby comes into contact with someone who has an infection: mother, In this module, ASHA will learn to manage asphyxia using a mucus extractor. 
Objectives of the SessionBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Know key signs and symptoms of sepsis.• Know how to prevent sepsis.• Teach parents and family how to recognise high risk signs.• Identify children who have sepsis.• Facilitate immediate referral if required.
“Sepsis” means infection. In newborn babies, “sepsis” refers to any serious 
infection in the baby whether in the lungs, brain or blood.
55Part C
Newborn Healthfamily members, or ASHA
Can sepsis be prevented? Yes, if the following are observed carefully
• Good hygiene: frequent handwashing; clean instruments during delivery; 
clean clothes
• Keeping the baby w
arm during the cold season
• Breastfeeding (early initiation and on demand, and exclusive)
• Keeping the umbilical cord clean and dryInformation about danger signs to parents: You should teach the parents 
that if any of the following signs dev
elop, you should be called immediately 
or the baby should be taken at once for referral. • Limbs become limp
• 
Stops feeding
• Has chest indrawing• Has fever• Is cold to touch.
Management of sepsis
Sepsis treatment: Two antibiotics are used: Cotrimoxazole and GentamicinYou can start the treatment of sepsis by giving Cotrimoxazole:Cotrimaxozole syrup two times a day is to be given:
 
  ¼ teaspoon twice a day for seven days if baby is full term.
  ¼ teaspoon twice a day for ten days if baby is pre-term.
• Gentamicin injection is to be given once a day. You can refer the parents to 
the nearest PHC where there is a doctor available. 
• If parents are reluctant or are unable to go, you can request the ANM to 
help them.
 When to refer the baby
• Baby has breastfeeding problems and is not solved by ASHA’s counselling 
and home management a�  er 24 hours.
• Baby has danger signs:
 Not responding – a�  er antibiotic treatment for 24 hours.
 Becomes yellow (jaundice) on ﬁ  rst day or jaundice persists a�  er 14 days.
 Bleeding from nose, mouth or anus.
 Convulsions.
 Body temperature of baby continues to remain less that 95 degree F 
even a�  er re-warming the baby for 24 hours.

Community Level Care for Malaria in Areas where Malaria is endemic 
Malaria
Malaria is an infection caused by parasite (microorganism) called 
Plasmodium. This is transmi�  ed by the female anopheles mosquito. There are two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very dangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs. 
How does it spread?: When the mosquito bits an infected person, the parasite 
enters the mosquito’ s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’
s stomach and then 
when it bites another person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’ s saliv 
a and infects him/her . 
Signs and Symptoms
• The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur 
on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with Falciparum type infection. 
• Sometimes the patient has continuous fev
er, malaise, and headache.
• Malaria aﬀ  ects more frequently and more severely children below ﬁ  ve 
years, pregnant women, or patients who are already ill. 
• Falciparum malaria can aﬀ  ect the brain: causing clouding of 
consciousness, ﬁ  ts, or paralysis leading to death.Objectives of the session
By
 the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• Understand and be able to communicate key facts about malaria and its 
prevention.
• Making a blood smear and testing blood using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria. • Managing fever in the young child- when to suspect malaria, how and when to 
test, when to refer, when and what to treat.
• Understanding spread of TB and methods of diagnosis. • Supporting treatment of TB and follow-up with patients.ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
60Who is at higher risk? : In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant 
mothers and malnourished children are at greater risk.
How to suspect malaria: Any person living in a malaria aﬀ  ected area, who 
develops fev
er must be suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and 
rigor and headache, it is even more likely. 
How to conﬁ  rm: There are two ways of conﬁ  rming malaria:• Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit the patient’s blood can be tested 
for malaria (Please see Annexe 4). If the test is positive then the patient 
has malaria. 
• Y
ou should also make a blood smear. (Please see Annexe 5). The parasite 
can be seen in the blood smear Sometimes the blood smears can be negative, and a repeat smear is required. 
 
RDT and Smears are to be taken before starting treatment. All ASHAs 
working in a block with a high incidence of malaria need to be trained for taking smears for malaria. 
Treating Malaria
1. Give paracetamol for fever. Also sponging with warm water to bring 
down temperature when needed.
2. If RDT is positiv
e for malaria- Give chloroquine or Artesunate 
Combination treatment (ACT) drug as recommended. (Annexe 7) The dose of the drug depends of the age group. The exact dosage schedule is given in 
Annexe 6. Nowadays the recommendation is to treat for malaria 
only if the test is positive. If the test is not available, or cannot be done, it is permissible to give a course of chloroquine. This would still be needed in many areas. 
3. If despite treatment fev
er does not begin to come down within two or 
three days, or persists even a�  er a week, referral becomes mandatory. 
Referral to ANM or doctor is necessary if there is no response and fever continues 
or if patient becomes delirious. 
Prevention of Malaria
Mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There 
are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito that transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at night. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in clean water. That is why during rainy season, where water collects, this forms a good breeding place for mosquitoes. 
ASHA Module 
 7
or if patient becomes delirious. 
Part D
Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 61Ways of controlling malaria: There are two ways:
Do not allow mosquitoes to multiply :
• Spraying insecticide where mosquitoes sit when they 
come to bite inside the houses.
• Drying up breeding pits.
• 
Not allowing water to stagnate- pouring a spoon of 
oil over the water surface in small collections. This is enough to kill the mosquito larvae. 
• Enable cultivation of Gambusia ﬁ  sh in ponds and 
wells- these eat up the mosquito larvae. Also remove the grass from banks of pond. Larvae ﬁ  nd it diﬃ   cult to breed if there is no vegetation and the pond edges are vertical. 
• Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in 
one place and it should be ﬂ  ushed and cleaned once in a week.
Do not allow mosquitoes to bite• Clothes that cov er the body
 , like full sleeved shirts. 
• Mosquito nets treated with 
insecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net may die later . 
•
 Use of mosquito repellent, e.g. 
burning neem leav es to driv
e 
mosquitoes away.
The Role of ASHA in Prevention and Management of Malaria
i. During house visits and in the village meetings you should inform 
the community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. You should also inform the community of the services you can provide for malaria and request that for any case of fever you should be contacted.
ii. Encourage and help the village health and sanitation commi�
 ee and the 
women’s groups or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. 
iii. Where possible, ask those with fever, who you suspect of having malaria 
to go to the primary health centre. You should facilitate this. It is only if the patient cannot go the same day, that you should take on the task of diagnosis and treatment of the suspected patient with malaria till such time as the qualiﬁ  
ed service provider is accessed. 
ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
62iv. All fever cases that approach you and are unable to go to the primary 
health centre within a day, should be screened using RDT and blood 
slides. Fever cases which turn out to be RDT positive should be provided treatment immediately. You should store the positive RDT along with the blood slide for Quality Assurance (QA) check at a later date. For cases which are RDT negative, you should send blood slides to the laboratory. For those with a positive result, you can treat the cases following the drug regimen in which you are trained. 
v. All fever cases should be given paracetamol and fever managed as per 
the guidelines. The persons who test positive for malaria would be given with either chloroquine drug or ACT drugs (depending on the instructions in that area) followed by primaquine for radical treatment. 
vi. Whenever you do a blood test or give a drug you should make a record 
of it in your diary. You should, provide the information during the monthly ASHA review meeting to the ANM or to your supervisor. If payment is being made for this work, you may be also required to maintain a register.
vii. Transport of slides and obtaining the result of the test: The 
slides collected by you should be delivered to the sub-centre by you or by anyone whom you request, on a day to day basis. These slides should then be transported to the PHC lab preferably twice a w eek, or less by the MPW (M) 
and if not, the MPW (F). The results should be conv
eyed to 
you by the MPW (M) and if not the MPW (F). 
viii. If there is a pregnant woman in a high malaria area, you 
should facilitate her ge�  ing a insecticide treated bed net at the time of the ﬁ  rst antenatal care check up and follow up to see that she uses it. A�  er delivery you should ensure that the baby from the time of birth also sleeps under an insecticide treated bed-net. Diary
ix. If a pregnant woman gets high fever and chills, ensure that she is taken to 
see a doctor. You could start Chloroquine or ACT  immediately if there is a delay in seeing a doctor.. Do NOT give primaquine to a pregnant woman or a child below one year of age. Part D
Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 63Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious bacterial disease caused by a germ 
(Mycobacterium tuberculosis). TB can aﬀ  ect any part of the body. When it aﬀ  ects the lungs, it is called pulmonary TB. The commonest form of TB is pulmonary TB. It aﬀ  ects over 2 million people in India. TB in any other part of the body (i.e. other than lungs) is called extra-pulmonary TB.
How does TB spread?
TB germs usually spread through tiny droplets in the air, when a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis coughs or sneezes. When these droplets are inhaled by a healthy person, s/he gets infected with TB. This infected person will hav e 
a 10% lifetime risk of dev eloping TB. Spread of disease is increased in poorly 
v
entilated houses where many people live close together or in high dust areas 
like mines and quarries. An undernourished or malnourished patient is also at a high risk of contracting and dying of TB. Both drugs and nourishment are needed to achieve a cure in such persons. Children can also get both forms of TB.
 When should TB be suspected?
The symptoms of pulmonary TB are:• Cough with sputum for two weeks or more
• Pain in chest• Sometimes the presence of blood stained sputum (haemoptysis) with 
symptoms like:
 Rise in evening temperature
 Night sweats
 Loss of weight
 Loss of appetite.
A person with cough for two weeks or more is a suspect for TB and should be 
referred to a PHC/CHC/DH for the confirmation of diagnosis. 
How to diagnose TB?
Sputum examination is the main tool for diagnosing pulmonary TB.
The diagnosis is made when the germ is present in the sputum of the 
patient. At least two sputum samples have to be tested (one of which has to be collected ﬁ  rst thing in the morning at the patient’s home and the other at the health facility). A receptacle for collection of sputum at home is given to the patient at the microscopy centre at the health facility). The two samples should be collected for examination preferably within 24 hours. The sputum is stained by a special dye and examined under a microscope by trained personnel. 
ASHA Module 7

64The person is said to be a TB patient if the germ is detected in both or one of 
the two samples. Patients who are sputum negative for germs but who still exhibit disease symptoms should be referred to the Medical Oﬃ   cer (MO) who may order other investigations like an X-ray of the lungs.
 Diagnosis of TB must be done by a Medical Officer.
What is DOTS?
DOTS programme is “Directly Observed Treatment” in which a health worker or another trained person who is not a family member, watches as the patient swallows the anti-TB medicines in her presence.
What is ‘Cure’?
A patient who is initially sputum smear-positive and who has completed treatment and had negative sputum smears on two occasions, one of which was at the end of treatment, is declared a ‘cured’ patient.
Treatment and Management of TB
• Diagnosis of TB is done through X-ray, sputum examination.
• All patients who have TB need to be treated with anti-TB drugs which can 
take up to six or nine months. 
• The current approach is through Directly Observ
ed Treatment, Short 
Course (DOTS).
• P
atients must take the drugs regularly and not stop before the speciﬁ  ed 
period even if they feel be�  er.
Prevention of TB
• BCG vaccination of children can prevent TB 
among small children. BCG is given at birth.
• Finding cases and ensuring compliance with 
treatment is important.
• Improv
e living conditions. 
• ASHA should discuss TB during health 
communication sessions
• ASHA
 should encourage old people and 
those who are vulnerable with cough for 
over one month to visit a doctor
.
• ASHA could serve as a DOTS provider in her village and ensure 
compliance with treatment. Part D
Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 65Your Role in the Treatment Phase 
• You could serve as the DOTS provider in your village 
and ensure compliance. 
• Since the treatment is of long duration, the 
ASHA has 
a key role in motivating the patient to complete the 
treatment and prevent them from stopping midway or drop out. 
• Recognising the side-eﬀ
 ects of the drugs (Annexe 8) 
and knowing how to deal with side-eﬀ  ects of drugs and making sure of drug availability at the health facility will help you to do this more eﬀ  ectively. 
• Encourage the patient to take suﬃ   cient nutrition 
during treatment and moderate rest at least for the ﬁ  rst two months.
• The family of the patient should be counselled to take precautions at 
home especially for children and elder persons who can contract the disease quickly .
• 
The patient must eat and drink from a separate set of utensils which 
should be washed separately. When coughing, the patient must put a protective clean cloth over his mouth to prevent spread of droplets or leave the house and cough in a nearby open space. The cloth should be washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis. 
• The patient should not have close contact with spouse, children and 
infants and the elderly within the family at least for two months a�  er starting treatment. Simple hygiene precautions will help in prev enting 
transmission of TB within the family.
• You must keep a watch on the other family members to detect early signs 
of TB in the members and if necessary, get them examined from time to time.
• Ensure BCG v
accination of children at birth. This can help prevent TB 
among small children.
• TB is also a stigmatising disease. Conﬁ
 dentiality of patient identity must 
be maintained. 
• A
wareness of TB related symptoms and the approach to achieving a cure 
through self-reporting for examination must be stressed at community gatherings as also the importance of good nutrition and taking of complete treatment.

66• Relapse of TB in patients who have had previous treatment is possible. 
Many times, such patients are considered as new patients. The record of 
previous treatment should be made known to the health facility where the patient presents for re-treatment so that a diﬀ  
erent drug regimen may be 
prescribed.
Precautions for Anti-TB Treatment among Pregnant Women
• Women in child bearing age should be counselled to avoid pregnancy 
while on anti-TB treatment and at least six months a�  er.
• The eﬀ  ect of oral contraceptives is reduced by medicines and hence, other 
methods of contraception should be advocated.
• One of the TB drugs, Streptomycin, should not be given in the ﬁ  rst 
trimester of pregnancy.Annexes69 AnnexesAnnexe 1: Home Visit Form for the High Risk Baby

• Take a clean glass slide free from grease and scratches • Clean the ﬁ  nger of the patient using a spirit swab
Take the following steps for preparation of the blood smear:
i. Select the second or third finger of the left hand 
ii. The site of the puncture is the side of the ball of the finger, not 
too close to  the nail bed 
iii. Allow the blood come up automatically. Do not squeeze the 
finger.
iv. Hold the slide by its edges 
v. The size of the blood drop is controlled better if the finger 
touches the slides from below 
79 Annexesvi. Touch the drop of blood with a clean slide, three drops are 
collected for preparing the thick smear.
vii. Touch another new drop of blood with the edge of a clean 
slide for preparing the thin smear.
viii. Spread the drop of blood with the corner of another slide to 
make a circle  or a square about 1 cm
ix. Bring the edge of the slide carrying the second drop of blood 
to the surface of the first slide, wait until the blood spreads along the whole edge
x. Holding it at an angle of about 45
o push it forward with   rapid 
but not too brisk movement
xi. Write with a pencil the slide number on the thin film, Wait 
until the thick film is dry.  The thin film is always used as a label to identify the patient. 
Remember 
• The blood should not be excessively stirred. Spread gently in circular or 
rectangular form with 3 to 6 movements. 
• The circular thick ﬁ  lm should be about 1 cm (1/5 inch) in diameter.
• Allow the thick ﬁ  lm to dry with the slide in the ﬂ  at, level position 
protected from ﬂ  ies, dust and extensive heat.
• Label the dry thin ﬁ  lm with a so�   lead pencil by writing in the thicker 
portion of the ﬁ  lm the blood slide number and date of collection
